I've noticed that when people post things, they generally say \"this is my opinion\" before stating what exactly they think. This leads me to believe that people who feel uncomfortable changing their minds usually post things where they're going to explain why they changed their mind and why they didn't change their mind in the first place. I'm not saying that they shouldn't post things that are controversial, but I think that people who post things like this tend to be more comfortable changing their mind than those who post things where they aren't going to justify why they changed their mind. \n\nIn short, I think the purpose of the subreddit is to allow people to learn how to think for themselves.

I think that's where this whole issue starts to get interesting though. \n\nWhat I mean by \"conforming\" isn't necessarily agreeing with everything that's said here. It's more about accepting the fact that we're all in the same boat, and having some say in how we want things to turn out. In my experience, when you talk about conformity, people tend to be very defensive. They feel they must conform or else they'll fail at something important, and they won't let anyone tell them what they should or shouldn't do.

I believe this since most of it has got to do with emotions to be honest. My family and I have been screwed over numerous times by the authorities. As for the logical part, well my reasoning is that basically we see people cooperating with each other without any strong-arming or self-interest at all! Take a look at how people helped their friends, family ,etc.! And then my second logical reasoning is that power corrupts! This is evidenced by the fact that the government(Kuwait where I was born) arrests homosexuals, and the U.S.A. government arrests drug users, even if they aren't violent. Lastly, look at all the jackasses that are in power(U.S. Senate votes that climate change is not caused by humans)! Next is the fact that I believe that prisons are unnecessary and even dangerous. My reasoning is based on that prison is simply crime college. Basically people who go to prison, simply learn new skills for committing crime! This is evidenced by the fact that people go to prison a long time for usually minor crimes, such as breaking windows, while those who do major crimes, are given short prison sentences as evidenced by the recent cop brutality news in the U.S.A., anarchists have different viewpoints, but the main idea is that we find government unnecessary.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is only possible to get along in society when everyone agrees on certain policies and values. Without government, some may be forced into doing things that they wouldn't otherwise, and it is only possible to make sure everyone can agree on these laws and values when someone else does something against them.\n\nThe last point is somewhat similar to yours, but I feel like it is more accurate than \"power corrupts\". Power is corrupt because it is used against the weak. For example, the government uses police powers to keep criminals out of the streets and out of the public eye. By making law enforcement stronger and more efficient, it makes it harder for criminals to commit crimes. The government also uses money and other resources to maintain itself. Without these resources, it will fall apart and the economy will collapse. \n\nSo I think the last point is more accurate. Government is necessary because it allows society to function properly. Without government, society would fall apart and become chaotic. I don't believe that government is necessary because it doesn't allow for the freedom that citizens enjoy today.

The number of federal workers is much larger than the number of cops, yet it seems to be a much smaller number. \n\nAlso, the police force can't be replaced by any other means unless they are willing to pay higher taxes to cover the costs. In the US, the cost of running a police department is roughly $20 billion annually. If every state ran a police department at the same rate, the cost would be approximately $300 billion per year. It's difficult to imagine that the police wouldn't need to hire additional personnel, especially after a few years. \n\nThere is also no reason why states couldn't run a similar system of policing the public without having a large military. The military currently spends around $700 million per year, so if a state wanted to use the same amount of money, it could hire soldiers instead of hiring more police. \n\nSo yes, the state police force isn't necessary anymore.

Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange. What kind of person evaluates actions in their personal life based on this kind of statistic? For example, picking blueberries in the forest is extremely bad for growth of economy: low skill job and doing things yourself means you won't be buying blueberries from other people. Growth of economy means one should buy processed, marketed, branded food producs in the store and abandon working electronic devices whenever a new model comes to market.\n\nOne could do that, yes, but I find it laughable how this is the priority goal for politicians - not health, literacy, justice, equality or some other virtue. When asked why economy should grow, they give contrived reasoning from dynamics of economy. They ignore that economy seems to work in cyclic process of growth and decline.

How can someone strongly support economic growth while having no interest in either means or results of it?\n\nComment 1: &gt; Economy means exchange of goods and growth of economy is thus increase in exchange.\n\nThe economy also includes the exchange goods *and services*, not goods alone.

I don't think it's fair that people who don't smoke have to work while people who do smoke (an addiction brought on by themselves) get to leave work for the 5 minutes it takes to go smoke a cigarette a few times during their shift. Three of co-workers take smoke breaks at least 4 or 5 times during a shift and I continue to work. I can't really take a break myself because I don't really have a reason to take a short break (because I don't bring my cigs to work). \n\nSmoke breaks have been a very common thing amongst most of the jobs I've had.

If someone feels the need to smoke, they'll get frustrated when they don't smoke and become less productive. To keep them productive and happy workers, they'll let them smoke to keep everything going smoothly.\n\nComment 1: It is smarter from a business manager's stand-point to keep employees happy while maintaining work output. The path of least resistance to achieve this, when dealing with smokers at least, is to let them have their smoke breaks and keep them in \"working condition\". Since you have shown that you don't need a smoke break, it wouldn't make any sense from that stand-point to let you take a break for no reason. You don't \"need\" one.\n\nI realize that does't sound fair, but look at it from the manager's perspective. We have worker A and B in a door hinge factory. They both work at the same pace, making the same amount of door hinges per hour. Worker A smokes; Worker B does not. Worker A gets irritable and is less motivated to work if he doesn't get his nicotine. So, the manager lets him/her take their smoke break so they can keep up efficiency.

It's cheaper to hire a smoker than a non-smoker. There's less chance of being fired. And you're more likely to be promoted. People who smoke are often more creative, and more successful in life. People who smoke are often better educated, and more financially successful. Smoking helps improve blood pressure and heart rate, which reduces the likelihood of heart disease.

I believe that most of the time, when this argument is used, it is either protecting children from something they do not need protection from and often are things that should be actively discussed with children.\n\nFurthermore, when this argument is used to advocate for something that actually protects children, the detriment to society is generally larger than the benefit for children, e.g. even if drug usage does increase among teenagers after legalization (which I strongly doubt), the negatives of prohibition far outweigh the consequences of more teens doing drugs.\n\nNote: Arguments for increasing socialized benefits do not fall under this argument, as they are beneficial to all of society, not just children.

In a place where smoking isn't illegal, people aren't allowed to smoke, so that wouldn't work.\n\nThe same thing happens with drugs. There's no way for the government to say \"You can use marijuana without breaking the law\", right? It won't happen, but it's still possible.

Since many people have crappy incomes this would include much or all of poorer people's debts. No one should feel worried that due to debts they have that they will lose their family, home, car, stuff like that.\n\nThe super rich would be affected by this in that if their debts would cause them to go below the amount of money they need to live those debts wouldn't be enforceable. \n\nI see those who use excessive debt to extract lots of money from people as parasitic, worsening society with the forgetfulness and poor decisions of people. I don't believe that poor decisions should lead to heavily negative arguments so any arguments to change my view based on it being a net positive that the poor are hurt because they're stupid or have it coming is likely to not change my view. \n\nI'll note now I don't really care that much about large debts of businesses or super rich individuals- the 1% and such, who control the majority of money. If your suggestion to change my view is that businesses would be ruined by this it is less likely to be an effective argument. I am not suggesting we touch their debt with this law unless they are caused to be in poverty by their debt.\n\nI'd also support banning debt collection agencies.

That is why there is no need to have \"unsecured\" debt, since that is only relevant to the tax system, not the legal system. \n\nI agree. I think I've misunderstood the distinction between individual and corporation income. The difference is that corporations pay taxes on profits, while individuals do not. This means that the government can take a huge chunk out of every single person's paycheck, but not out of their salary for work they do. So even though you could get paid more by a corporation than by an employee, there's still no way that you can afford to put extra money into your personal bank account at the same time as you're paying taxes.\n\n&gt; I'm going to give you a couple of examples to help you understand how these issues play out:\n\nIn the first example, let's say that you have $50,000 in savings.

My point is that personal choice does not have any economic value. When you have personal choice, you can choose to spend that money on anything you want, but if you cannot afford something, then you can't get that thing. This means that even if you can't afford to buy a new house, you might still have enough money to buy a new car. In fact, I think this is the way most people earn their money and therefore how most people are able to purchase things. When you don't have enough money to buy a house, you may end up living somewhere else where the cost of housing is lower. When you don't have enough money to buy a car, you may end up buying a car that has a better fuel economy or a smaller size. \n\nNow, if you say that personal choice doesn't matter, I'm sorry but I disagree.

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that.

If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Then in that world there would be no reason to praise or reward someone for doing the moral thing because there is no other option. Likewise, there is no one who could possibly be punished (like sending them to hell for instance). Clearly we do not live in such a world, but religious individuals/groups who insist that something should be illegal or made nearly impossible due to religious views are trying to make our world more like the one in the scenario I suggested above where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Thus, forcing people to comply with the rules of your religion actually seem to make the rules less meaningful which seems like something that religious individuals would want to avoid.\n\nNote, I'm only talking about things where the main reason for believing them is religion - like beliefs about gay marriage, premarital sex, drinking alcohol, etc. Therefore, things like the belief that you should not murder people would not count as having a primarily religious nature because most people also find murder horrific in a separate sense from religion.\n\nTo phrase it differently, if all alcohol disappeared from earth tomorrow and humans somehow could no longer make it, would abstaining from drinking alcohol mean anything? I don't think so.\n\nWithout having the choice to do the 'wrong' thing, then doing the 'right' thing is meaningless.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

For example, you could explain that you believe it's okay to drink, even though many people do not like alcohol, but that it's still immoral to drink anyway. It might be easier to understand, for example, why someone should not be able to vote in an election if they cannot support themselves financially. It might not be easy to convince them that voting is immoral, but it doesn't have to be. So, you might have to convince them that it's immoral to vote, but you don't need to tell them why they shouldn't be able to vote.\n\nI suppose the biggest issue I had with religious views on morality was that they were too much dependent on logic and science.

This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.\n\n- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. \n\nThe only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.\n\nReddit, change my view!\n\nPD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. \n\nEDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine.

It depends on how you look at accidents. Most accidents happen when a motor vehicle is involved with another vehicle, which happens all the time regardless of who was driving. Even if someone doesn't drive, they can still cause a collision by hitting something else, such as a tree, house, etc. \n\nIt also depends on what type of vehicle was involved.

I feel like I might have (sub-)consciously shied away from considering the notion of becoming a vegetarian, because it's not something I wanted to \"trouble\" myself with thinking about. But whenever I *did* start to think about it, I felt like there's no real justification to continue eating meat.\n\nWe use (ab-use, even exploit?) other species, other living creatures, for our own convenience and pleasure. Sure, this isn't something limited to us humans, because animals eat other animals as well. \"Eat and be eaten\" is a well-established natural concept, a result of a few billion years of evolution. But evolution is also the reason the human race became intellectually superior to other species, and it's what caused us to develop such a thing as a moral code. As a result we abolished other \"natural concepts\" such as violence or sexual assault. Nowadays, we also have the means to compensate for any kind of nutrients or vitamins we might be missing out on if we didn't eat any more meat, from food supplements to easily available vegetarian alternatives. So, because it's unjustifiable to continue this practice, there isn't a reason why I shouldn't become a vegetarian other than personal comfort and laziness.\n\nI'm aware that this argument can also be extended to find reasons for becoming a vegan, fruitarian, and what-have-you.

You could say \"entertainment\", but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is *right* versus what is *wrong*.   \n \nI was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong.     \n  \nHere, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue.

Equally it would free up huge amounts of crops that could feed needy people (?) or assorted others. \n\nFinal note: As a human being I believe I have a moral responsibility to try and prevent suffering as I have freedom of choice, What differentiates me and a bear is free will to make moral decisions which a bear is incapable of understanding.

Parents who deny their children the right to vaccinations because of their superstitions or religious beliefs are harming their children and should be held legally responsible. Failing to vaccinate either your child and even yourself is irresponsible behavior and not only are you putting your child at risk, but you are also putting others around you at risk as well. Children who can't receive vaccinations and develop immunity to the diseases rely on the community to get vaccinated. Therefore, refusing to vaccinate your child is not only a form of child abuse, but it is also putting others at risk. It's not a personal choice issue. It's civic responsibility. Everyone should be vaccinated and everyone should be required to vaccinate their children.\n\nComment 1: It's only dangerous to children if they were to get the disease they were not vaccinated to. What if a parent not vaccinate their kid because he knew that there was a strong herd immunity in the area that he lives at?  There is no danger and the possibility of getting the disease would be very rare. I would guess that does not constitute as child abuse.\n\nComment 2: I got this great example from the Centers of Disease Control website addressing this same issue. Herd immunity is like riding in a car pool where everyone contributes each month to pay for gas, repairs to the car, etc.; and one morning a new guy shows up and says, \"I think I\u2019ll ride along with you. But I\u2019m not going to pay, since you\u2019re going downtown anyway and you have an empty seat.\" If enough people choose to take a free ride on other children\u2019s immunity, herd immunity will soon disappear. This is reason for why all recommended vaccines are necessary whether or not the possibility of getting the disease is really low. If you don't vaccinate your child, your contributing to their harm and longterm to the community as well. It's child abuse if you're doing something that harms the child.\n\nComment 3: Yea I've heard that too, but the point of herd immunity is that a sufficient amount of the population is vaccinated so that the disease can't spread.

If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver.\n\nI don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so? If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder.\n\nI can only see positives to mandatory organ donation. CMV.\n\n*Edit: Your replies have me convinced. Thanks. Opt-out organ donation is the way to go. Opt in leaves too few organs, whereas mandatory donation upsets a metric fuckton of people for a huge number of reasons.*\n\nComment 1: Presumed consent is a better option.  By most estimates, presumed consent would produce a huge increase in organ availability, while avoiding the [reactance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391039) response that people tend to exhibit when they perceive that authorities have taken away options or restricted their former freedoms.\n\nBy preserving the individual's ability to object, you'd also prevent religious conservatives from using your mandatory organ donation law as a springboard to curtail bodily autonomy in other areas for the purported greater good.

In the UK, there's a very clear definition of presumed consent, and the government uses it almost exclusively.  I think that it would be even more useful in the context of Wales, though, since there is no universal definition of \"presumed consent.\"  It's hard to say whether it's even necessary, or whether we need a completely new definition.\n\nBut that said, I still think that it's worth mentioning.  Perhaps you could come back with a slightly different argument about why you feel that it's better.  That was my main point, really - it seems like a reasonable alternative to opting-in.  And I agree that it would lead to fewer organs being donated, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  So, I guess I'm just asking what you think.\n\n&amp;#8710;  \n\nI've changed my view, thanks for explaining it to me!  &amp;#8710;\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to change the other person's view.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n&gt; Presumed consent is a better option\n\nThat's great news!

It certainly isn't perfect, since it still allows those with no choice over whether or not to donate to refuse, but it does provide something which was missing from the existing law - a means by which you could decide whether or not you wanted your organs donated.  \n\nYou can say that the law is flawed because it doesn't allow people to refuse, and that you're asking for it to be changed. However, you've already done that in the form of an amendment, and you haven't had any problems with it yet. That said, it may be worth exploring the concept further to understand why it hasn't been adopted more widely. As I mentioned above, I think the key advantage of it is that it prevents religious objections from having a significant impact on how the law is interpreted.\n\nThe other point is that you can't use the same argument for the opt-in law, because if you change the law, you're going to need to amend the opt-out law to deal with the new", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1hhk6u", "utterance_id": "t1_caueegk", "response_tokens": 51, "context_tokens": 474, "grader": "claude-sonnet-4-5", "preference": "1", "is_equal": false, "reasoning": "Response 1 is more persuasive because it directly acknowledges the commenter's point and awards a delta (the CMV symbol for changing one's view), which is the appropriate response in this context.

Since, I don't enjoy reading the newspaper and I don't believe I have the capacity to make meaningful changes, I believe that reading the news is a waste of my time.\n\nOn a local level I agree that following the news is important. However, on a national and particularly international level I have a minimal impact. One example is the upcoming fight over the debt ceiling in the US. Regardless of what I want I cannot influence my representative's vote, because this is a such a polarized issue everyone is voting on party lines. Knowing about this event influences my future voting, but I don't actually need to know the details. I only need to know which representatives voted against my wishes so I can try to get them unelected. \n\nInternationally, there are events like the civil war in Syria. Knowing this war exists I can choose to send aid. However, knowing the intricate details of the event are irrelevant to my life and don't impact my ability to help Syria. \n\n Since I have a larger impact on local issues and I have limited time it is more efficient to spend my limited time on local issues. Given that my focus is on local issues, my news consumption should also be on local issues. \n\nThere's also the argument from apathy. I just want to keep my head down and live my life. I don't see how understanding the debt problems Greece faces has any impact on my life. Granted, the debt crisis in Greece affects the US economy, which affects my life. However, **knowing** about the debt crisis doesn't.

All I mean is being able to at some point in my life find a girl to marry who is compatible with me, on terms that are equally respectful to both myself and her.\n\nLet me give a bit of background. I'm a 29 year old successful professional with a full and interesting life. From my point of view (and from taking dating advice), I'd like to think that I have a lot of qualities that women would find attractive. Do you think women are drawn to success or money? I went to a top-5 school, I make money well into the six figures, and I own over $1M worth of real estate. What about creativity or intelligence?

Despite what you'll probably infer from this post (due to the nature of it), I'm actually both confident and modest in real life. And finally, the \"be attractive/don't be unattractive\" dichotomy? Well, I'm certainly not accidentally unattractive -- I'm in great shape, I dress in flattering, fitted clothing, and I take care of my hygiene. As far as \"be attractive\", I'm average, which shouldn't hurt or help me either way. I have my minor flaws in appearance, but so does everyone.\n\nI'm not looking for a supermodel genius.

This means finding someone you know who has similar interests to you.\n* Be open-minded about meeting people. Don't dismiss them based on their appearance alone. Ask them questions if they seem interested in you, and be willing to listen if they say no. It's okay to ask them if they have something specific in mind for themselves, and it's important to keep an open mind.\n* Be consistent in your behavior. Try to dress professionally, eat healthily, be nice, and be friendly to everyone you interact with.

If you're only interested in people who are going to have kids, then yes, you'll still be able to have a nice relationship with them. \n\nSo, if you really do love women, and you're willing to put in the work necessary to become one of them, then yes, you'll be able to have that relationship. Otherwise, no matter how much you love someone, you'll never be able to form a healthy relationship with them.

Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly \"niche\" category of movies. \n\nI think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only \"right\" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase.

This means they'd have to pay the government a lot of money to issue the bitcoins, and this money would eventually be returned to the public, which would cause the price to drop. In addition, the fact that the bitcoin network isn't decentralized doesn't make things easier either, since anyone who wants to use Bitcoin needs to trust the network to keep its promises, and the only way to do that is by having the network run by governments or private companies.

I think I understand exactly what people mean when they say it. I just don't personally find myself using it or thinking of something as being overrated, because of the way that I think about art and media, and I wish more people could see things the way I do. \n\nBut I'm looking for someone to shed some light on what they think overrated means, because maybe I'm taking it to an extreme that others are not. \n\nWhat I mean is, generally when people say something is \"overrated,\" they mean, \"this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people, but I don't like it. Therefore, I don't understand why so many people like it, or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.\"\n\nI personally do not believe in superlatives or assigning \"greatness\" to something that is purely subjective. I am a huge movie buff as some of you might know, but I don't have a personal list of \"greatest movies\" because I don't think you can rank movies based on which is \"best,\" since everyone has different criteria. However, if you asked me what the greatest movie ever is, I might say VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, because there is a consensus among critics that it is either one of those two movies. Therefore, when I say \"VERTIGO is the greatest,\" I am NOT stating an opinion, I am referring to the consensus of the canon of film criticism. \n\nI think greatest in these sense refers to \"most influential\" or \"most written about\" or \"most often said to be the best by people who are in the business of saying such things,\" in which case \"greatest film\" could be an objective label, because I think influence and popularity are objective qualities, as opposed to the subjective act of enjoying something.

Are you arguing against the idea that overrating is objectively wrong? Or are you arguing against the notion that overrating is subjective?\n\nThe latter, at least from my perspective, is what this thread is all about. If I were asking whether I should call the Beatles' 1970 album \"the greatest rock album,\" then I would argue that I do not consider it an overrated work of art, and I certainly wouldn't call it overrated by the same standards as other great works of art, such as Shakespeare. It's worth noting that the Beatles album was actually released on vinyl in November 2006 (after I'd already been writing this for years), and even though the album is now nearly 50 years old, it still holds up very well in its own right. And yes, it was considered the greatest rock album of the 1970s, which probably makes it more important than it would otherwise be.

While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  \n\nUnfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  \nRaising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.\n\nIn addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.\n\nUnfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.

That being said:\n\nWhat happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?\n\nI think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:\n\n* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.\n\n* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy.

Therefore, if someone wants to satisfy their partner, they need to be willing to put themselves out there and make sex happen regardless of whether the person they desire is fertile.  The most important thing for the relationship is mutual satisfaction, not having sex.  If a person can't meet their partner's needs without sacrificing his/her own, then the relationship isn't functioning properly.\n\nAs far as making it easier for the person who is naturally less fertile to satisfy their partner, that's something else entirely.  It's not like the person who doesn't get enough sleep is going to automatically find their partner in bed.  That's just not how it works.  Making it harder for them to satisfy themself requires some effort from the other person - either physically or emotionally.

Yet I have always vehemently(perhaps fallaciously) argued with people who claim that consciousness cannot possibly be a result of biology, and greater metaphysical notion of the soul must explain its existence.\nI maintain that our consciousness is simply an expression of biology, and that there will come a point in time at which our understanding of the brain will catch up with our understanding of the rest of our body. At this stage, we would be capable of creating consciousness similar to our own. I believe that our current inability to explain the nature of our self-awareness is rooted in ignorance of our biology. I have no concrete scientific knowledge on which I rest my argument besides the fact I cannot see a reason to believe that a metaphysical explanation is necessary. This ignorance about the brain is comparable to people in bygone era's being unaware of how our bodies functioned. As developments in anatomy allowed us to map each blood vessel in our bodies so to will neuroscience map each neuron in our brain.\nThis is a difficult existential idea to tackle, and is an uncomfortable position to hold as it indicates a lack of true free will and the existence of determinism, which in turn has implications on our ideas of morality.

The only problem with your argument is that you haven't addressed the fact that this process doesn't necessarily require us to understand every detail of our biological processes. \n\nLet's say for example that we discover that certain neurons fire when a particular thought comes to mind. Then we can create consciousness based on this information, but we won't actually be able to create consciousness without first knowing the specific details of how those neurons respond. And yet, even if we knew all of these details, we might still be unable to produce the specific thoughts that cause them to fire. That's because there's no way to predict all the possible combinations of events that can occur. So even though we've discovered all the details of how certain neurons react to particular stimuli, we'll never be able to create consciousness until we know all of the possibilities.\n\nI'm sure that this kind of logic can be applied to many other areas of science, but let me reiterate that I don't think you're really addressing my question.

So while it might seem strange to think that human thought is distinct from biology, it may not be impossible that it exists independently. However, I don't think this makes it any less real or relevant.\n\nEdit: I'm not sure what you're asking here - if we know that the brain contains neurons, then it doesn't follow that they're all working together to create conscious thought. That's exactly the kind of assumption you make when you say \"our brains contain information that allows us to think\".

The creator makes a great point about the flaw in the voting system, but at one point he makes the point that neutral voters who change their mind from election to election determine who wins.\n\nTo begin, I do think that the voting system is flawed, but in many ways what it has led to is two very centrist parties who only really differ in ideology. While this does not make for great conversation on capitol hill, it certainly does effect what really happens when bills are written. \n\nThe best example that I can think of this happening would be with the bailouts/stimulus packages. Both republicans and democrats wanted to help their constituents, so they were both forced to compromise. Republicans may have not loved the idea of a stimulus, but they were willing to do it, because it helped them to get the bailout for banks/auto companies. While it is debatable how successful these things have been, it shows how having two relatively centrist parties willing to compromise has been good for America. \n\nEDIT: So a lot of people are bringing up the flaws in FPTP, and I do actually agree with that thought. But I still feel like it could be better than the alternatives of allowing more extreme ideologies, even like Green and Libertarians a powerful voice. I think that it could divide the country even more. Not only that, but suddenly the ideology of Republicans and Democrats would become the moderates. That is where my concern still lies, and why I still that that FPTP may still have to be the best possible systme for the United States to use. \n\nEDIT 2: Thanks you guys for the great responses!

Well-adjusted adulthood also extends these recognitions to others.  Think about it - we tend not to require those we love to be anything other than who they truly are.\n\nIn other words, in adulthood superpowers are irrelevant.\n\nGiven that, it's hard for me to understand how adults can maintain an interest in comic book heroes since so little of what these stories are about has any significance to the adult world.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Just as a preface, I am not a speed runner and I don't watch a terrible amount of speed running. The majority of my knowledge comes from a few Super Meat Boy speed runners and Dark Souls 2 speed running. \n\nIt seems a common tactic in the speed running community to use tricks in the game to quickly get ahead. This is exactly what you would expect from someone trying to finish the game as fast as possible; however, often times these \"tricks\" can cause the player to completely skip a large portion of the game. My main example would be what's referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super Meat Boy. \n\nBrownie is a boss in super meat boy on the world called the Salt Factory. In order to beat him, you have to outrun him through a maze like structure and get to the top of the structure. Doing this normally could take a little longer than a minute. Perhaps less, I don't know the exact amount of time, but definitely significantly more than when using the exploit. Performing the Brownie Skip, the player is placed into the race, runs immediately to the right outside of few and pauses the game and then ends up being able to land on top of the platform that was initially impeding their progress. If you don't know or that explanation didn't make sense, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvT8CQWYbxM) is what it looks like. \n\nIn my opinion, this and tactics like it don't belong in speed running. While it does make you beat the game faster, you're not actually playing the game. You're playing \"who knows how and when to pause the game and how to wiggle the stick\" the best. The idea of speed running is about being able to beat the game the fastest and bosses are an important part of the game. Actually beating the boss shows off more skill by far.

It's challenging and it doesn't feel like you need to play at your absolute maximum speed just to survive, because there isn't anything stopping you if you want to stop at any point during the run.\n\nI agree with that, though I'm also pretty sure that most people who love Speed Running are really good at it, so I'd say that if they do find themselves having a hard time beating a certain type of game, they probably just need to learn some of those strategies you mentioned.\n\n&gt; I think that Speed running is fun because we aren't trying to beat the game, we just want to keep going. I understand that this might sound strange, but the way we play our games is that we try to stay within the rules, we always aim to beat the clock, we try not to waste time and we try not to miss anything.\n\nThat sounds like a good approach, but I think that even with that strategy, the game still requires constant planning and preparation.

I know that in almost every situation, they are ignorant and unjustifiable. But I've been pondering something for a while now that I frankly don't see as all that unreasonable.\n\nI like bowling. I go bowling non competitively a lot. There are a lot of times when I go to the bowling alley and there will be a group of Indians bowling near me. I've always noticed that they, more than any other people I'm bowling around, will have more balls than anyone else. A majority of them are never used. To put this in to perspective, a group of three will have seven or eight balls, most of them put under the rack where balls aren't being used. This can get frustrating when I can't find a ball with the right weight and hole size that I need and I see that they have one but aren't using it. Yes, I understand that I can't just blame them for being the only ones who do this, I know that there are a lot of people who get way too many balls. Just the coincidence in my experience that nearly every group of Indians does this is curious. The Indian-to-non-Indian-rude-bowler-ratio is when I can't help but notice this.\n\nThe other thing I noticed is that they don't seem to have regard for the proper etiquette of waiting until the player next to you is done bowling before you bowl. It can be really difficult to have a good game when you get distracted by someone else running up next to you. Again, I know there are a lot of people guilty of this, but the coincidence is just too weird. \n\nI've just noticed that I automatically jump to the conclusion that the Indian people playing around me will do those things. 9/10 they do. In any other setting, I have absolutely no prejudice with Indians. Every time I'm bowling with Indian people around, should I have an unbiased outlook? Should The Dude simply abide?

They also tend to be better educated so if they want to learn, they can take classes. \n\nIn terms of how much balls they have, I can't say for certain because they could have a different amount depending on their location. But the fact that they have fewer balls than non-Indians doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing it intentionally. That's a good question. Maybe they're not being selective about the balls, but maybe they're doing it unintentionally.\n\nAs far as waiting until someone else finishes, I think that's completely normal behavior. It helps to prevent accidents and also makes it easier to keep track of who has the ball. When I was younger, I remember going to play bowling at the local community center. If I had wanted to start a game, I wouldn't have waited until someone else finished. I would have started right away. \n\nIt's very common to see people wait on the side of the lane after the first player has completed their turn, so they don't get hit.", "rejected": "&gt; I think that's what makes it interesting - the fact that it happens on a daily basis and has such a high frequency.

I mean, I know I shouldn't be so casual about it, but I think it's perfectly acceptable. What if someone was offended by it? They'd probably call it \"unintentional\" and it wouldn't make sense to me anyway. Also, you're talking about a large portion of your population (3%), whereas most of the Indians who come here are actually very nice. I know some of them might be rude at first, but then they become nicer and start enjoying themselves, which makes it even better. So, I guess I'm still okay with it. I also think that Indians are not racist because they are not racist. It just seems to be their natural behavior, which isn't necessarily bad. \n\nIf you're going to say that I should be kinder towards Indians, I'm fine with that, but I also think that there are plenty of people who are racist who aren't racist.

If this is the case, then yes, I agree that it is possible for people with very low IQs to make decisions like you suggest, but I disagree that they could be considered intelligent.

Your example of a politician who is a member of the right-wing extreme group \"pro-life\" is actually quite close to my definition of intelligence, since he is able to recognize that his position may be seen as immoral or even illegal by other members of the party and therefore must change it. He might also have to consider the moral implications of his position, which requires him to have some understanding of ethics and philosophy, something which most people cannot achieve without intellectual aptitude.

Your body is your body, and you have the right to choose who you are inside. There's nothing wrong with identifying as male, female, trans, non-binary, etc. It doesn't make you any less of a human being. It does however mean you need to take responsibility for it. That means learning new skills, changing your wardrobe, taking care of your home, finding a job, paying taxes, having kids, buying groceries, etc.\n\nIt also means you need to know when to stop and get help, whether it's a medical diagnosis, counseling, therapy, etc. To do otherwise is to fail your own body, to be ignorant of it, to neglect your body and the way you want to live. You may even find yourself feeling ashamed at times, wondering why you chose to have a certain gender, and why it feels so wrong. It's okay to feel those emotions, and to deal with them. The important thing is to learn about yourself, and be able to navigate life without feeling shame or guilt.\n\nAnd yes, some people might feel confused by their gender", "rejected": "&gt; I think that's what makes me uncomfortable.

But when it comes to defining someone, they must fit into the existing social categories, and those categories aren't set in stone. They're subject to change, just as any other category. So, to answer your question, yes, it could be argued that your experience of masculinity and femininity is subjective and relative to societal norms, and that you could potentially define yourself differently than others who share similar experiences. \n\nIn other words, you may find yourself feeling more feminine and less masculine. That doesn't mean you're wrong, because you do feel differently. But you still have to come up with some kind of criteria by which you can determine whether you fall into these categories.

It seems like, once a piece of entertainment persists for a certain amount of time, it becomes perfect--whenever anybody criticizes it, a legion of loyal fans rush to defend it. Any flaw is either imagined or excused by saying \"It doesn't matter, because of x and y (usually having to do with the time or situation in which it was created).\" \n\nA good example of this is Lord of the Rings--in my experience, a lot of people hold it up as being one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time. Tolkien did an amazing job worldbuilding, certainly, but his focus on the world means that other parts suffer. He drags the reader through slow scenes that don't move the plot forward, then recounts battles and other action-focused sections of his books as if he is writing a history--in other words, he essentially tells the reader what is going on, then brushes past them. I'm not saying that LotR is terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but it is put on a pedestal that it doesn't entirely deserve when compared to other fantasy books.\n\nThe works of Charles Dickens are another quick example: The man was paid by the word, and it shows. His books are good, with some excellent bits and a lot of padding.\n\nI'm rambling, but the point I'm trying to make is this: Classics, in the arts, are not perfect, but people often insist on treating them as if they are. I think that they should be respected for their place in history but given more realistic portrayals when compared to more current works.\n\nThe work of a child prodigy is considered impressive for what it is, but it does not instantly become great art unless it is comparable to the best work by adults. Its flaws can be explained by saying \"A child did it,\" but they cannot be excused by it. I see old things the same way. They are impressive and deserving of respect, but not flawless, and the flaws cannot be excused by saying \"Someone did it a long time ago.\"\n\nCMV.\n\nComment 1: &gt;Classics, in the arts, are not perfect, but people often insist on treating them as if they are.

The problem is that we still have the benefit of reading something that has existed for much longer than anyone else could read it. In fact, we still have the benefit of reading something that is better than anything else out there.\n\nThat being said, I am not saying that the works of Shakespeare are perfect, nor do I want to say that they aren't worth reading. I am simply pointing out that they are timeless classics and therefore worthy of appreciation despite their age.\n\nIf you were to tell me that every single book ever written is perfect, that would be an absurd statement. That would be an absolute lie, and yet that is exactly how the literary community operates. If I told you that every book ever written was perfect, you wouldn't believe me! Why would you believe me?

That's true, but that still leaves us with a few other possibilities:\n\n- Something is truly original. Like the Mona Lisa, where the painting is unique to the artist, but also unique to the moment it was painted.\n\n- A work of art that has been around for a sufficiently long time that it's part of a tradition. The story of the Harry Potter books is not so much a novel but rather a collection of stories that were first published over a hundred years ago.\n\n- A book that is written by someone who is famous enough that there's a book club that reads it regularly. Or, worse yet, a book that someone who is famous writes that everyone knows nothing about.

Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low.

The risk is, let's say, 4% in 100 years\" Reality is, we will not act on it even if acting would be logical and sound from an economic point of view alone. \nSure, we should improve education first, but it's not a fast process and in the meanwhile Bangladesh is at risk. Real lives, real humans are going to suffer if we do not act.\nSo I think it's ethical to lie, exaggerating potential risks, to force the public opinion in the right direction, as fast as necessary to implement the most effective strategies. The end justifies the means. I am a logical person myself, I have an education in engineering and physics, I value the truth, I recognize that lies can have a damaging effects in the long term. Still I cannot think any other way to accomplish the same result. CMV.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

For example, let the New England area become its own country, or even join with Canada for that matter should they desire to. The makeup of this area of the country is being hurt by the rest of the country. The policies they wish to see implemented are being blocked by other groups of people hundreds or even thousands of miles away. \n\nLikewise for the South. If the majority of people in the South want less government, and to let religion be a powerful force in their politics, why not let them? Why should people far away deny them of this?\n\nI also think we would do the world a favor by breaking apart militarily. Perhaps we can remain a continental coalition militarily, but a large part of the country would never commit their troops to another engagement like Vietnam or Iraq, thus limiting the scale of which \"America\" could be involved in a conflict.

That's where the \"career\" part of the word comes in. \n\nWell, yes, but there aren't enough jobs out there right now that require these kinds of skills. \n\nThe reason that History isn't as relevant as it used to be is that we're getting much better at finding information quickly online, so we don't need to read books anymore. When we do get to read books, we tend to skim over the parts that we don't need, instead reading the chapters that contain the most important facts. So, the amount of useful information available doesn't necessarily increase when we teach History.\n\nThat said, there are still plenty of interesting historical events that don't exist in textbooks anymore.

As someone who has been a history professor myself, I agree with most of the points that have already been raised here (especially the last paragraph), but I think that the only thing that I would add to this discussion is that history teachers should focus on teaching their subject rather than teaching it to their students.

Respecting the divorce decree that granted her ex-husband visitation rights with his kids, but no custody, she petitioned the court in Illinois,USA,where they lived ,to give her leave to relocate. She outlined a new visitation plan and told the court all the details of why she wanted to move and how it could be arranged to keep her kids in regular contact with their father and the Illinois side of their family. The petition was ultimately denied by the court and on an appeal because the father made claims that the move would obstruct his decreed visitation time, and give the woman too much control over the nature of the visitation with the kids.  If there was joint custody I would be more inclined to concur with the courts but in this case I cry foul ball. \n\n I'm not sure I disagree with the courts' decisions rationally because they weighed the circumstances pretty solidly, except maybe I don't see how there can be any objection to the woman, with full custody, retaining control over the nature of the visitation with her kids; nor do I understand how the fact that the father couldn't afford to keep up visitation in another state should become the mother's burden especially when she is willing to help fund the continued visitation; and finally also why they didn't factor in the reduced visitation sending the eldest child to a boarding institution might cause on all parties.The kids are all relatively advanced in age, and I am not an opponent of father's rights, but I do think the outcome was unfavorable in this case especially considering the situation with the hou\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; But I'm not an opponent of father's rights\n\nYou're not.

If it's not \"convenient\" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.\n__\n\nEdit: Thanks for the heaps of downvotes everyone. This thread is over.___\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It was really just an attempt to create a new term, rather than rephrase something already used.\n\nI've been thinking about this for quite a while now. The only thing I can think of is that I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable by not being able to breastfeed their children, but then again, I could be missing something important here.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many of the reasons given (e.g., \"the baby needs the attention\") are somewhat subjective. Some parents find breastfeeding extremely annoying because it requires constant attention, while others find it incredibly enjoyable simply because it allows their child to receive the love and care he/she deserves. \n\nSo maybe it's not so much about nipples being painful or uncomfortable per se, as it is about how it impacts the parent-child relationship. Perhaps it would be better to talk about it in terms of how it affects the parent-child relationship overall rather than just nipple comfort. Or perhaps we could just say that it's a matter of preference. \n\nBut even if it were a matter of preference, the situation would still seem awkward to me. Breastfeeding is clearly an incredibly personal decision made by the individual, and I feel that it's unreasonable", "rejected": "I agree that this isn't something that applies everywhere. That's why I was so concerned with the specific laws in California. \n\nBut, as far as I understand, they apply to public places. Public spaces can include restaurants, movie theaters, shopping malls, etc. \n\nNow, I suppose if you lived in the country, or had children, or whatever, that would be different. But I've never thought about those issues before. I mean, if you were living in the country and didn't have kids, would it still make sense to enforce the laws?  \n\nSo yes, there may be some legal ramifications, but maybe not worth it to me. Perhaps the reason it exists is because we're all bad, and we all need each other, but no matter how hard we try, we can't find anyone who truly cares enough to do anything about it.

If you were able to get your own social fears by yourself or find your own courage or learn to relax by yourself, that courage/new ability to cope in social situations would stick with you as opposed to going away when you aren't under the influence anymore. Turning to these substances for reprieve seems very weak to me.

It also isn't necessary and every possible possible effect it could have on you is able to be accomplished through other means.\n\nI want to prematurely thank you guys because I'm very obdurate in my view of this but I really want to change it to help me be more accepting of what others around me do.

However, older people often have more varied or extensive life experiences to draw on, and do not generally make decisions in a vacuum.\n\nFor example, imagine a relatively long (30+ years) period of peace. All of a sudden, war is a possibility. I would like my decision-making body to have at least a few people who might have had prior experience with a war.\n\nAdditionally, when you elect someone, like your senator, you're not just electing them, you're also electing their entire staff.

As an example, if I were to decide to go into law school, would that mean that my parents chose me to go there? Or would that be my own choice?\n\nThe idea that I could choose my own path is very interesting.  That's where I'm coming up short though.

If you can give me some examples, I'll try to figure out how I could implement this in my life.  I really appreciate your help!\n\nEdit: Thanks for helping me clarify.  I should have been clearer.  My main issue seems to be that I don't want to be responsible for my own future decisions.  When you talk about being responsible for someone else's actions, you're talking about taking responsibility for your own actions, right?  I think that's why I'm not comfortable making those kinds of decisions.  Maybe I'm just too lazy to take responsibility for myself.

I would summarize it as\n\n&gt;Homosexuals are people who feel sexual attraction for the same sex for yet to be known reasons (or no reason at all). This behavior gathered the hate of people in many cultures and led to the marginalization of gay folks on post-christian cultures. This led to extreme situations of social anxiety and other things, but [here starts my own vision] after the events of 9/11 and the advent of neo-atheism, influential gay people started campaigning without fear of religious persecution and since they are slowly earning the respect they deserve.

It will help you find a way to cope with the fact that you may never be able to hide from society for long periods of time. \n\nThe only thing I disagree with you about is the idea that the LGBT community has somehow become \"unacceptable\". It's true that the LGBT community has had a very difficult time getting acceptance in mainstream society, but it's also true that we've made huge strides towards acceptance. \n\nI agree with most of your points here. But I do not see any flaw in your reasoning regarding why people who are heterosexual are often criticized for being gay. They are not. They simply choose to be different.

I'll admit to having a few questions:\n\n1. Is it fair to say that corporations have made the economy run by default?  Are they required to make certain things happen that aren't necessarily in their best interest?  I know it's true in many cases, but does it really matter to society when companies make things happen without consideration for how those things affect the general public?  Can it really be considered unfair to make something happen without giving any thought to the impact it may have on others?\n\n2. Why do I feel that corporations deserve capital punishment?  Because it seems like they get away with killing people because they've gotten rich enough to buy them out, or because they're able to hire the best workers at the lowest cost possible.  In both cases, they're doing business in ways that benefit themselves and their shareholders.  What about a company that doesn't need to survive financially to make the corporation profitable?

Capitalism doesn't care about the rich people. It's only interested in profits. That's what capitalism is really all about. \n\nAnd yes, it's not the rich people that get rich - the rich people are the ones who buy everything and make sure the government keeps their taxes high. But when it comes to how much money they make, they're always getting less than the rest. So while the rich aren't necessarily communist, they certainly don't want to be communist. And since they don't want to be communist, there isn't going to be any pressure on them to be communist. \n\nI know that sounds like a lot of assumptions - but that's what capitalism is all about. \n\nIn short, I agree with you. You're right - capitalism is not communist. But that's not the point of my argument. I actually believe that capitalism is not communist because it benefits everybody. I believe that capitalism is communist because it benefits the rich and those with power over the poor and powerless alike. \n\nSo what?

{"prompt": "[SYSTEM] You are a respectful assistant trying to persuade the other person using honest, well-reasoned arguments. You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: At least as the U.S. political environment currently stands. I think this applies to all elections, but to explain myself I'll just give a single example. The obvious example here would be the previous presidential election, fought primarily between Obama, Romney, and Ron Paul. My opinions on Ron himself aside, voting for a libertarian presidential candidate was a waste of a vote for anyone who chose to do so. I believe that anyone who, at least when it got closer to election day, honestly thought that Ron Paul would magically shoot up in ratings and somehow nab the election was either grossly misinformed or simply ignoring the facts in front of them. \n\nIt would have been smarter, and I think more pragmatic, to just suck it up and vote for either Romney or Obama. I get it, some people didn't like either of them, but the idea that there really was any more than two options was just an illusion, so it would have been better to vote for whichever you deemed the lesser of two evils, and if you wish, support your choice of third party candidate in other ways so that they perhaps have a better chance next election season. I know this is just one example, but I think the same thinking could apply to any past or future election. I could summarize by saying that in such important instances like presidential elections, pragmatism trumps ideology nine out of ten times, and voting third party simply isn't pragmatic. And with that, CMV.\n\nEDIT: Oops, completely slipped up there, forgot it was Gary Johnson not Ron Paul in the 2012 election. My bad.

I've dated a handful of girls and after getting to know them, the majority of them admitted to me that they've kissed other boys and since I knew them pretty well at that point I was able to move past it but I'm not sure if I could have forgiven them if they had told me they'd had sex.\n\nI'm not with anyone right now and I feel very limited by the fact that I'm not interested in dating or potentially marrying a girl that has had sex, even if they look back on it as a mistake. \n\nAnd since it's related to the topic; I have never had sex, never kissed a girl, but I have gotten physically close to some of them.

I am going to make my points bullet form so the are easy to respond to. Also just before i start i want to make it clear that that i have 100% respect for the troops of WW1 and WW2 because those wars involved mandatory service, and real threats to the safety of the planet. Also I respect the troops as human beings, just not for their possible view/actions. Anyways my points are these.\n&gt;1. **When you look at war from a countries point of view, it makes sense why people would think they are fighting for the \"right\"(patriotism and lies about motives) how do you KNOW that you are fighting for the right? Every time a soldier comes home for your country, one doesn't come home from another country. It all seems so pointless and primal when looked at through a global perspective**.\n&gt;2. **I've seen alot of soldiers state that they are there for peaceful purposes, and if that is the case, why don't we have a peacekeeping organization that can be signed up for opposed to the military. In my opinion, 2 organizations seperated like this would have completely different view on how to handle situations. If we do have an organization like this, why not join that**?\n&gt;3. **I just don't see how going in to kill people can be respected, especially when they are sometimes innocent, a classic example is the \"collateral damage\" video, where it is very clear they are not there for peaceful purposes**.\n&gt;4. **Is there any points to the wars we are in right now, other than money for the contractors and equipment providers?

How does that change anything?\n\nYou're correct. The mindset has definitely changed, but it's not the same as the one that existed during the 19th century.\n\n&gt;It seems that it is kept around solely for the purpose of keeping the economy running\n\nThat's true. I'm not saying that it shouldn't be used, but I'm not sure how you'd reconcile that with the idea that everyone wants peace, or even peace for themselves. \n\n&gt;There were a number of reasons why the military was formed. One reason was to defend the nation against foreign aggression. Another reason was to protect American industry and commerce.

The more awareness for what it is, the better.\n\nI have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because it's been bothering me.\n\nLittle background: I've never been clinically diagnosed (I'll get to why later), but for the first 2 years of college, something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends, to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly 50 pounds over those 2 years, and I was failing all my classes. I wasn't even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also, I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them, but it occupied my mind quite a bit. \n\nI wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time, and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it, and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasn't able to do any of that. Like I couldn't get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that, and I still do. \n\nSo here's where it gets interesting, and here's where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost 3-4 years ago so I'm forgetting exactly where the shift happened, but the summer after my 2nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head (obviously), and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations, when the situation is neutral by default.

When you're in a bad mood, your mind is foggy, and you can make poor decisions based on that. But when you're in good mood, you can look at things objectively and make informed decisions. So instead of focusing on your negative feelings, you focus on your positive ones. \n\nIn short: you need to learn to be objective. That means taking things one step at a time, looking at things objectively, and only focusing on what matters. \n\nNow, this doesn't mean that you can ignore everything else.

I really believe that it helped me feel better and that it made me feel like I could make progress. I also believe that the medication made me realize that my thoughts were in my head, and that I was capable of changing them. \n\nIf you ever hear yourself saying \"I'm going to try to stop drinking\", you need to remind yourself that you aren't completely alone. I know how many people have felt the same way before, and they haven't gotten anywhere.

With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\n\nI've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?\n\nFirst of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so.

This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.\n\nFor example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were \"just following orders,\" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.\n\nPoverty can make good people do evil things. \n\nDrugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.\n\n---\n\nLet me explain what I understand by \"good people\" and \"evil things.\" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?\n\nA \"good person\" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the \"outside force\" is religion.\n\nAn \"evil thing\" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. \n\nIn order to CMV, please:\n\n* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.\n\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "The word \"evil\" doesn't mean that we shouldn't treat everyone equally under the law, but rather that the law applies differently to different groups.

If one group of people gets killed while being treated by the police, it's not necessarily because of a religious belief system, but because of a law. If one group of people gets arrested for killing another group of people, it's not necessarily because of a religious belief system, but because of a law.

Religion creates a barrier between the two sides of the argument and removes the possibility of both parties having a rational understanding of what they're talking about.\n\nThe other side has to deal with a bunch of emotional pain.

I strongly believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and if you're not hurting anyone, then you get your freak on and be whoever you are.  \n\nHowever, the labels are getting to be a bit too much.  I agree with a sentiment that I see all over the CMV sub:  a lot of these labels are created by attention seekers who can't stand to be part of an already defined group and must create their own category.  No amount of evidence, arguing, diversity seminars or PowerPoint slide presentations will convince me that there's a difference between bisexual and Pansexual.  However, I have no dog in this fight.

For example, one of the reasons why I'm not transgender is because I chose to identify myself as male.  So, if I were to say \"I'm transgender,\" I would be confusing myself with another individual who identifies himself as male and would thus fail to provide accurate information. \n\nThat said, I do understand how it feels for some people to be labeled as \"transgender\" because they choose to go by that label instead of calling themselves \"male.\"  I understand that sometimes people might find", "rejected": "&gt;I do subscribe to the rather antiquated notion that what you prefer to do in the bedroom is your\n\nYou could say that, but it doesn't change anything because everyone prefers something in the bedroom.

There may be more than one relationship where one partner feels comfortable sleeping with the other.  Some couples might choose to live separately and not share bed space, some might choose to sleep together, some might choose to sleep at home, and some might decide that both partners should sleep somewhere else, such as in a hotel room.  So, the question isn't whether or not you like to sleep with your partner, it's whether or not you like to sleep with someone who likes to sleep with you.

But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.\n\nI realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.\n\nKnowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?\n\nEdit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one. So thank you for the good conversation as well.\n\nComment 1: It entirely depends on your situation. If you have no music library building up 1000 songs (legitimately) will cost you roughly 1000 dollars. This is 8 1/3 years of Spotify premium which would give them access to those 1000 songs plus all other songs that have been and will be released during that period.\n\nIF you are someone with 1000 songs already but find yourself spending $120 a year on music then you'd be strictly better off buying spotify as this would allow you to acquire those new songs you want while also giving you access to all the other songs available.\n\nThe only real question is if you spend less than $120 on music per year.\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;So what is the difference between the two options? \n\nIf you buy 120 songs/year, you're essentially paying 120 songs *per year*.

In contrast, if you choose to listen to music for free, you're essentially paying for 1000 songs *plus* whatever you paid to add, meaning you don't have any savings from it.\n\n&gt;It's worth noting that both Spotify and Apple Music have \"free\" content added to their platforms. That doesn't mean you won't have to pay anything. \n\nYou're right, but that does change the equation. When you consider how much money you spent, it makes more sense to purchase music from either platform rather than purchasing songs from each individually. The reason why Spotify offers free content is because they provide it for everyone, even those without a music library. They also charge a monthly service fee for the additional content. If you own a music library, you would likely be charged extra for the music that has already been purchased.\n\n&gt;", "rejected": "&gt; I am not saying that Spotify is perfect.

I've come to realize that what I was hoping for when I bought Spotify was that it would just let me do whatever I wanted, without having to worry about music or being able to easily share music with others. The problem is, when I opened Spotify, I realized how little music I had actually got myself. I don't feel like I have anything special, except for some cool apps that I love, like Pandora. I still prefer the ability to listen to my favorite artists and bands even though I might not be able to hear all of their songs. When I'm not listening to music, I'm usually reading books or watching TV. In short, I feel like Spotify doesn't help me as much as I thought it would.

Plant-based food systems use much fewer resources. It also takes longer to grow, since plants need time to grow before they produce sufficient food. In addition, plant foods generally require less water than animal products, and they tend to be much healthier overall.\n\n2) Animal farming is unethical - it involves cruelty to animals, forced confinement in unnatural conditions, and exploitation of animals' natural instincts.

For example, if you lived in a society where everyone could freely choose how they wanted to live their life, but there were only certain foods that you couldn't eat, it wouldn't matter whether you ate beef every day or chicken every day.

I understand that it's the most read book in world literature, and Christianity is the biggest religion. But a non-christian staying in a hotel can't really do much with it, aside from the aesthetic viewpoint (and although this is just my personal opinion, there are much better-written books than the Bible). I think the 'moral lessons' in the Bible can be found in tons of other great literature. Why not a Koran or a Tao Te Ching? Or why a religious book at all? I'd much prefer a greater variety of books, a Dracula in one room/hotel, a Ulysses, Crime and Punishment or Harry Potter in another.\n\nSo, try your best guys, convince me: why a bible over any other book?\n\n\nThank you, /u/GnosticGnome, /u/Cullpepper and /u/down42roads for informing me that it is not the hotel but a christian organization that provides these bibles.

The Bible is an incredibly important text, and I'm sure many people would love to hear what it could teach them. So maybe we shouldn't focus solely on the fact that Christians can't use it as much as other texts. I still think that if they did, the difference in quality wouldn't be too big, but I'd say that if we were to take the Bible away from Christians and replace it with something else, I'd probably be okay with it. \n\nThat said, I do find it odd that you would want someone to read something as important as the Bible if they're not interested in it. Maybe it's because you don't actually enjoy it, but I don't think anyone would argue otherwise.

We had a lunch of sandwiches and realized we needed to be back at our conference soon for a panel, and so we asked for our food to go. My two compatriots boxed up their lunches and I simply wrapped a napkin around my sandwich and took it to eat while we made our way back to the convention center; prompting my Montrealais friend to comment on how weird it was with my Atlantan friend agreeing with him. This perturbed me, and over the course of the convention I ended up bringing the topic of eating while walking to others there, almost all from the US but none being from my home town of New York, and it seemed to be the consensus was that it was, in fact, weird to eat while walking.\n\nThis literally had never dawned on me before. I almost always take my lunches to go in New York and eat it on the sidewalk heading back to the office. Any food that's wrapped in bread (sandwiches, burritos and even slices of pizza) are designed to be eaten without containers or utensils, which make them ergonomically designed for being eaten on the go.\n\nSo, please CMV, or at least illustrate to me why this might be seen as so strange.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I know that many of us walk around in public and do not realise that we are doing it, but the problem is that we are supposed to do it. Therefore it does not feel weird to us. As such, I believe it is not only weird, but also inefficient to try and live off the ground while walking. To be honest, I think that this is one of the reasons why people tend to stay at home more. They do not want to waste time walking around, especially not when they can save their energy by staying inside.

For me, he is literally too perfect, and as such, he doesn't have a personality. I find this to be a huge character flaw, and I just want a character that actually has weakness inside of him. Yes, I realize his \"weakness\" is Kryptonite, but he has no mortal weakness besides his love for Lois Lane, and that's not a very interesting weakness in the first place.

In Superman stories the drama rarely comes from whether or not Superman can punch some other guy harder, or fly faster or whatever.\n\n\n It's much more likely to be about how this God-like being finds his way in the world. He loves humanity, and in many ways is a human at heart himself. It's about him doing his best to act as a role model for us. To help us but not control us. To make us the best we can be on our own through his inspiration, instead of lesser beings forced to grovel at his feet.\n\n\nAlso, while he is very very capable, and very powerful, he's not omnipotent or omnipresent. Every moment he decides to take time for himself he's allowing dozens, sometimes hundreds to die.

I mean, isn't Superman just one person?  The idea that all people need to be superhuman is ridiculous, given how little difference there really is between each individual person.  Even if they were identical twins, there would still be some differences between them.  Why wouldn't everyone in the universe need to be superhuman?  \n\nThe only real reason I'd ever believe that might be if I lived in a parallel universe where every single person was superhuman, and I wasn't even around to see their life.

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.\n\nI believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering.

I am actually interested in having my view changed.\n\nFirst, let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being, particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household, and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of 16. Even when I would question some things, I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor, youth group leader, family member or friend. However, as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own, I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith- not out of rebellion or disdain, but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact, at this point I thought that it was simply God\u2019s way of making me a stronger Christian, and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However, as time went on, I continued to pray, read, and talk about the doubts I was having, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God (or at least the God of Christianity, at that point). When I stopped believing in God, it was not a decision, but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true. \n\nThat all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few back-and-forth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion, but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs, I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my family\u2019s beliefs, because they really do try to respect mine as well, but the\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;I don't want to sound like an idiot, but I've never been a big fan of religious groups or religious teachings.

He does have to put in some hours, but it is still less than being able to make a living by working for a company and earning a salary. \n\nBut if you want to be a plumber, you're better off hiring someone else who is good at plumbing and paying them decently. So why is it that people choose to hire people who are more qualified than them, when they know that their own skills are superior?\n\nWhat happens is that once they decide to hire someone, the employer then takes on the costs of training, insurance, etc. The employer pays for their own equipment, which they use themselves.

For instance, I just demolished Brycen in Icirrus City with a decently leveled (higher level than two, lower level than the third) Darmation. I didn't even have to heal before reaching the leader, it was so easy. I remember back in Pokemon Red, each gym leader created a different challenge because there were only a few ways to genuinely crush the leaders because they were exactly that: leaders in their various gym types. Brock was a tough match because if you picked Charmander, only Butterfree was strong and diverse enough to take down the megalith that was Onyx. Same with Misty, you had yet to encounter electric pokemon so you had to crush her water/psychic types creatively, with a high level grass pokemon. It forced your team to be diverse, and it forced your game plan to be multifaceted. I have Darmation with a grass move, two fire types and one fighting type move and he basically crushes any foes I encounter. \n\nAlso, the fighting types are massive forces in this game because they had to dumb down psychics and dark type pokemon. \n\n\nSo reddit, CMV!\n\nEdit: a game, even if it is made for children, doesn't have to be stupid easy.

Being made for children doesn't mean games have to be easy. \n\nEdit 2: as stated elsewhere:  grinding, or fighting the same people or pokemon over and over again simply to gain levels to defeat a gym leader is difficult and not included in this gripe I have. Many kids overcome the difficulty issue by putting the time into leveling up their starter as much as possible and having them crush everything, and this makes things difficult elsewhere.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Inspired by [this comic](http://www.akimbocomics.com/comic/2010-10-04-Eat_Shit_And_Die_164.jpg), which is exactly the **wrong** way to deal with depression, I'd like to posit a few statements about depression and ideally you can educate me and change my view.\n\n**1. Depression is self-inflicted**\n\nPeople who suffer from depression are usually not billionaires, bon vivants and socially esteemed high achievers, but those who made bad decisions in the past. They maybe didn't follow through with their education, they maybe didn't find out what motivates them in life, they maybe abused drugs and/or alcohol, they maybe put all their effort in getting meaningless sex. Now they're an empty shell and don't know why.\n\nYou might point me to some celebrity exceptions, those who seem to have it all, but still suffer depression to the point where they even commit suicide. But do they really have it all? Some abuse drugs, some can't form a personal relationship, some become arrogant assholes.\n\nYou can change my view on this by giving me statistics that prove that sober, highly connected, social, educated people are at the same risk to become depressed as drug/alcohol abusing, shut-in, antisocial, uneducated people.\n\n**2. Depressed people can pull themselves up by their bootstraps**\n\nFollowing contention 1, depressed people can find out why they are depressed and do something about it. They can find their passion in life, they can become healthier, more educated, gain social skills, etc. If you're depressed because you don't have a significant other, work towards that goal. If you loathe your minimum-wage job, get higher education or start your own business. If you are disgusted by your appearance, work out and eat healthily.\n\nThe comic at the start simply addresses depression as if the people around the protagonist don't acknowledge or understand it. In my opinion, when someone tells you that they're depressed, you shouldn't tell them to snap out of it, but rather ask: \"What are you doing about it?\"\n\nChange my view.\n\nComment\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; I think that's what makes depression so awful. It's just too much for the brain to handle\n\nSo how does that affect our brains?\n\nI'm sure we can argue about whether depression is a disease or not, but it's clear that depression affects us in ways that make us miserable, and there is no one cure for it.\n\nIt's hard to believe that depression isn't a medical condition, but it is. So I wouldn't say that depression is worse than being sick. But it certainly feels worse, especially compared to being healthy.\n\nI'll be interested in hearing your thoughts! :D\n\n&amp;#8710;\u2206\n\n&gt; The funny thing is, I think you've got it right.\n\nThanks!

So how do we make sure people who are suffering from depression actually seek treatment?\n\n&amp;#8710;\n\n&gt; There's also the fact that depression is very common among college students. Many of these students have been diagnosed with depression, yet they continue to take classes, drink beer, play music, and do other things that would be considered normal for most people. These students may be suffering from depression, but they aren't being treated. And that's unacceptable. It's important for us to understand that depression is not a choice. It's not something that you decide to be happy, but instead, it's something that happens to you because of circumstances outside of your control. \n\nSo we should treat our depression as we would any other mental illness - by acknowledging its existence, providing information on its causes, symptoms, and treatment options, helping individuals to access resources, and ultimately, treating it appropriately.\n\n&gt; You can change my view by giving me statistics that prove that sober", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1scbek", "utterance_id": "t1_cdw63fd", "response_tokens": 138, "context_tokens": 451, "grader": "claude-sonnet-4-5", "preference": "1", "is_equal": false, "reasoning": "Response 1, while somewhat disjointed, attempts to engage with the complexity of depression as a medical condition and acknowledges uncertainty (\"I'm sure we can argue about whether depression is a disease or not\").

The US has no interest in maintaining a nuclear deterrent because it is not feasible. In fact, as far as I know, the only country in the world with an active nuclear deterrent is the US itself. The rest of the world doesn't even bother. So why do we need a nuclear deterrent at all? I mean, if you were to ask \"why do you need a nuclear weapon\" to the President, you wouldn't get a reply. They're there to keep us safe.\n\nBut yes, I agree that if the US wants to use them, they are going to want to do so. That's fine. But that means that the US does not have any leverage over us. If the US wanted to do anything against Russia, it would be difficult for them to do so without having to resort to nuclear force.\n\nSo the question is, **how many countries would be willing to use their own nuclear force against the US**? Well, I think we've already seen enough examples to know that the US is unlikely to use nuclear weapons against the US directly, but if we had to guess, it seems the US would most likely be", "rejected": "&gt; But the UK isn't remotely comparable\n\nThat's what I was hoping to do with this post.

However, I still feel that having such a powerful country behind us is important, so my view is somewhat limited by the idea that it doesn't matter whether it's an ally or not.\n\nI think you've hit the nail on the head when you talk about the UK being \"comparable\" - that is, it is comparable to France, Russia, China, Japan, India, and probably other countries in the region, etc.  For example, Russia had nearly 70% of their total nuclear force, which is far greater than the UK (53%).  The difference between Russia and the UK is also quite significant.  The UK has only 6-7 million tons of fissile material, while Russia has over 40 million tons.

That being said, I'm not going to argue with you here, nor will I try to convince you of anything. I do not think that the idea that we can only ever be heard because we've experienced some pain is valid.

People aren't really listening unless they are truly interested in understanding. \n\nMy point is that if you want to be heard and understood, you must genuinely care about how you sound.

It might seem strange to hear someone speak when you're talking, but there are many cases where people will speak without realising they're doing so. For example, a child might say something that sounds like he/she is upset, and then their parents will listen to them and make appropriate adjustments to what they're saying.

Often that employee's workload spills over onto his or her co-workers.  \n\nThere are plenty of people who have children who have other arrangements in place and are able to work their full shifts, so clearly there must be some kind of acceptable mechanism in place and there's no reason all working parents can't use it.  \n\nThe excuse that one needs to leave early to save on childcare expenses is not valid.

I don't have a problem with parents using accrued leave in order to leave early for specific events or emergency situations, just like any childless employee would be able to do as well.  \n\nThe problem is with parents being allowed to leave early (especially in salary situations, where their pay does not decrease by working fewer hours) and childless co-workers being expected to pick up the slack.\n\n\n* **Parents are always \"not it\" when someone has to work a holiday.**\n\nIn the case of 24/7/365 operations, childless employees are much more likely to get stuck working holidays.

Why wouldn't parents want to allow their kids to come in and play with toys while the teacher was teaching?  Or to eat snacks when the teachers were doing their snack break?\n\nAs far as I know, there's no hard and fast rule that says \"If you're going to take breaks at lunchtime, then you can't do something else\".  If you want to take breaks, then you can take breaks.  There's nothing wrong with making exceptions for certain activities.

I can only conclude that there is no conclusive evidence that demonstrate the utility of gun control laws.  \n\nThe dream scenario is obviously to remove all existing guns, to include those in the hands of criminals.  Only law enforcement will have guns.  However, that is impossible, criminals will always find guns.\n\nSo realistically, there is almost no chance we can completely get rid of guns in America.  Since we cannot un-arm the part of the populous that wants to do harm, the only reasonable solution is to arm the part of the populous that wants to defend themselves.\n\nEDIT:  It appears that I have to explain my plan to arm the populous.  It would be a gov't sponsored push for gun safety education (similar to driving), gov't sponsored campaign for gun ownership, tax cuts for 1st time gun owners, stricter background check on gun purchase, stricter laws for gun registration (like cars), free law-enforcement provided gun training, lower ammo prices.  The idea isn't to arm the populous to fight a war against the criminals.  The idea is to promote gun ownership to changer the perception of the criminal's evaluation of their potential victims.\n\nIf criminals believes that more people are armed due to this push for additional gun owners, they will have to re-evaluate the threat level of their victims, thus gravitating toward crimes that will be less likely to result in a dangerous confrontation with their victims.   Criminals don't want to die either.  So if they think everyone has a gun, instead of a home robbery at gun point, they are more likely to try to attempt a burglary when no one is home.  Instead of car jacking you on the street, they might try car theft instead.  Thus, making the society safer as a whole.\n\nTL;DR: Since getting rid of all guns is out of the question, the better way to increase public safety in relation to gun control is to increase the amount of guns through gov't sponsored programs.  The goal is to change criminal's perception of the vulnerability of their targets to deter them to commit \"riskier\" crimes.\n\nComment 1: The diffi\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; But what about the crime rate? We already have a problem with crime. How does it make sense to keep increasing the number of guns so that we're still able to stop crime?\n\nWell, first of all, if you are going to kill someone, then you probably won't use a gun. Second, even if you were willing to use a gun, it wouldn't necessarily save lives - most homicides are committed by people who have a mental illness or psychiatric disorder. Third, the cost of maintaining an army far outweighs the benefits of keeping the military strong, especially since the costs of maintaining the military far exceed the value of having soldiers. Fourth, if you believe that gun control makes you safer, then why don't you just buy some handguns from the local store and go into town and sell them to criminals? \n\nI'm not saying that every situation needs to be resolved with weapons, but I think it's worth considering how much money and resources we spend on gun control compared to the amount of money and resources we spend on gun violence. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that many people who have been killed by guns are also unemployed, which means that their families are left without income and food. That's a very real concern for many people.

But the thing is that I don't see how you're going to convince me otherwise. \n\nI understand what you mean by \"people should have a gun\", but that doesn't necessarily mean that there is an inherent risk to doing so. For example, someone who is unarmed and is standing up against a police officer could easily shoot themselves dead if they feel threatened. \n\nWhat I mean by \"risk\" is simply the possibility that something bad could happen to someone. It's just a matter of whether we can mitigate that risk by giving someone a gun. As I said earlier, I don't see how you can convince me otherwise. What I've been told is that there is no proof that the government will use these kinds of guns to commit violent crimes, but that doesn't really give us much leverage here.\n\nYou also seem to assume that there is a correlation between having guns and being more likely to kill yourself.

Feel free to try to CMV on that too.)\n\nFirst, the standard disclaimer, I'm not a racist, I think everyone deserves equal rights, etc etc etc. However I can't get this idea out of my head that whites just look a damn sight better than any other race, especially blacks, and I think I think I've seen enough scientific evidence to justify this view as objective rather than just subjective. I am aware that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it's just as important to realize that popular opinion matters, and if 99.9% of straight men would rather have sex with Marilyn Monroe than a broomstick, I think we can fairly say that Monroe is the objectively more attractive sack of carbon atoms, even if each individual opinion is subjective. \n\nOn to my arguments: \n\n-Cultures throughout history have almost without exception sexually preferred women who have lighter skin than average, even cultures that were not exposed to Europeans. This results in the best men mating with the fairest females, creating an upper class of people with the healthiest genes who have lighter skin tone. Whites, of course, have the palest skin of any large group of humans, and I believe this acts almost as a superstimuli by which white women are more attractive for having such pale skin, even when pale skin no longer indicates that they are upper class.  \n\n-There are very few blacks who are famous for their good looks. Despite the stereotype of black women being less attractive than black men, there are actually more black women examples I can think of: Beyonce, Rihanna, Kerry Washington, Halle Berry, and Zoe Saldana. The thing is, most of those women superficially resemble whites; Kerry Washington looks Caucasian in every way except her skin color, Rihanna has green eyes (which actually implies she has a closely related white ancestor), and Beyonce seems to have magically become several shades lighter when you compare her no\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; But I'm not saying that the reason why people tend to prefer light skinned people is because they like them or they don't like them, but rather that they do because of some inherent fact about them.

So, it makes sense that they prefer one version over another, regardless of whether it was chosen by someone else or they picked it themselves.

That doesn't mean they aren't attracted to black women at all, just that they are more attracted to them due to their skin tone. It might also be true that some black men are attracted to white women, but I don't think that's the case for most of them. \n\n&gt;I think your argument is flawed because there are plenty of other factors that contribute to attractiveness, not just skin tone. For example, one study found that people prefer Asian men who are physically shorter, taller, and weigh less compared to White men.\n\nThis is exactly why I disagree with you. There are plenty of reasons that some women choose to date or marry men who are shorter than themselves, heavier than themselves, and leaner than themselves, and these traits are not necessarily linked to a preference for men who are shorter than them.

It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone) \n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones. \n\n5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion.

I appreciate your clarification though.  Thanks!  I'm still very much open to new ideas, so feel free to give me another shot!  \u0394\n\nComment: The difference between a pizza and a calzone is that a pizza is a flat, round dish that's served cut into pieces and eaten at one sitting.  A calzone, on the other hand, is a piece of dough that's stuffed with toppings (cheese, meats, etc.) and then rolled up and served at one sitting.  While both have their own advantages, a calzone is significantly easier to serve and carry than a pizza.  In addition, calzones have less fat content than pizzas, which makes them healthier overall.  Additionally, since calzones are filled with toppings, they tend to last longer on the grill, unlike pizza that often gets burnt quickly after being cooked.

That means that you could potentially throw away all of your groceries and get a calzone without having to worry about anything else. This would be a great thing if the calzone were really the best thing, but I don't think it is. The calzone is basically just a pizza made from bread. So even though it has some advantages, it doesn't seem worth the trouble. If it was worth the trouble, then why wouldn't people buy extra bags of flour so they could make a bunch of these?\n\nAnd let's say that you're a regular pizza person and you've been getting used to the calzone since 2016.
