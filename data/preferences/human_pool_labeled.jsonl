I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off.

When you need to flush yourself, you'll probably use a bidet. \n\nI would argue that the toilet paper rolls are the way to go for most cases. They're smaller, more versatile, and easier to carry around. Plus, I'd argue that bidets aren't really necessary anymore. The toilet paper roll is just as good, sometimes even better. \n\nBut then again, there are lots of situations where a bidet would be needed.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: First, let me explain my position. I finished my first year of college recently and am still largely undecided on my major. I have put a lot of thought into fields of study, and am doing my best to come to a good decision. I am the type of person that most people expect to go into a mathematical/scientific field, and I am interested in the theory of both. At this point, however, I have reached the conclusion that they tend to be over-praised and see no reason to pursue a degree in the fields.\n\n**THINGS I AM NOT CLAIMING:**\n\n1. Science and math are useless\n\n2. It is universally a mistake to major in science/math (note: for the rest of my post, I only say \"science.\" Assume in all cases that I am still referring to both science and math)\n\n3. All STEM majors are poor choices\n\nWhat my position comes down to, essentially, is this: To obtain a science degree, a person must put forth years of effort--some useful, a lot drudgery--before they have any significant chance of producing something useful. For most scientific fields, a bachelor's is just the beginning, and if one intends to help with scientific advancements down the road, higher education is just short of critical. During this time, likely around eight years, a student will learn some fascinating things. However, that student will also be expected to undergo a lot of rote memorization, unnecessary classes, and busywork. During this time, the student is under significant pressure to maintain grades and stay at the top of everything, because (at least in the United States, and likely elsewhere) higher-level opportunities are limited. \n\nFinally, after those years of effort and study, the real work begins: advancing science. This is what most people who enter these fields want to do, to the best of my understanding. Even then, though, it is impossible to escape the drudgery. Science is a long, slow, often unpleasant process with occasional moments of excitement and success. Again, it is important to emphasize that those fascinating, wonderful moments exist.

Is there anything we can use from mathematics?\n\nWell, I guess my problem lies with the latter part of your statement, but I'll try to address it anyway.\n\nMathematics is valuable, yes.  It is an excellent tool for solving problems in many different domains.  However, as you said above, it isn't always practical, so much of the work done in math today involves developing new ways to solve old problems.  This is true regardless of which field you choose to major in.  In fact, I think you could say that the entire history of math is a story of how mathematicians came up with new methods for solving problems that were difficult before them.\n\nAs for science, I think you might be confusing the two.  While science does involve applying mathematics to solve problems, science is not necessarily about discovering truths about nature.  In many cases, science is simply about making discoveries based on observations and experiments.  In other words, scientists don't need to know much about the underlying principles of nature to make sense of their findings.\n\nIn addition, while some people might", "rejected": "&gt; But I'm not saying you shouldn't try!

There may be times when you feel like giving up completely, or feeling like you can't achieve anything because you have so little time left in your life. As long as you don't give up, and don't become discouraged by these thoughts, you can succeed.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: When discussing people in altered states, including those brought about through organic pathology or \"mental\" illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic depression, it is inappropriate and false to state such individuals are less in contact with reality.\n\nThe reason is that nobody experiences reality directly.  By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\nComment 1: You're saying that since the brain filters and processes sensory information, it is equally as \"in contact\" with reality as a brain on drugs? That is a [false equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence).\n\nHave you ever been under the effects of those drugs?

So when we talk about an animal being \"surviving,\" we mean surviving in order to pass on its genes.\n\nWhen someone is \"psychotic,\" their brain is working differently, but it still operates within the confines of the biological system.  They are just operating at a different level of the biological system, meaning that they have different limits.  So yes, we can say that they are less in contact with reality, but the question remains whether they are in any way less conscious.  It doesn't matter whether they are completely unaware of their surroundings, or they know everything that exists around them.  \n\nIt's also important to note that psychosis is *not* the same thing as being mentally ill.  Psychosis is when a person perceives things outside themselves as real.  Mental illness is defined by symptoms and dysfunction of the brain.

But I still believe that the experience of reality varies depending on whether it is filtered through a filter or not. It just seems strange that we need a filter to get past our own minds to experience reality. \n\nI'll admit, though, that I'm still a bit confused. Are you suggesting that the *filter* we use when making decisions is something that exists independently of our brains? I've never heard of a filter being used outside of our brains before.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: **Not all will succeed:**\nFirst off, I am conservative, not that the term means anything these days. However, as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more, but not all will, and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide, turn to prostitution, rob, steal, riot, etc. \n\n\n**Economy:**\nAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment, the job market would become oversaturate. This \u201cget a job, you slacker!\u201d mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery, but welfare is free money to the recipient; slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage, there is a chance (possibly small) that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a right-leaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect, but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesn't really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalist\u2019s game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is: we are getting stingy with our scraps.\n\n\n**The new Laws:**\nNow, laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons, including costs. However, the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents, and for good reason, fuck \u2018em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. \n\n\n\nIf welfare were to be rapidly dismantled, I believe the US would be in a worse state.

Welfare programs are designed to help people who are struggling financially, not those who aren't. If you're going to give away benefits, then you'd better be giving them to those who are struggling financially. That's not the same as handing out benefits to everyone. And by definition, welfare benefits are supposed to help people who are already struggling financially, not those who haven't. Therefore, welfare programs are inherently flawed, and therefore they must be eliminated. \n\nSo, to reiterate, my point was that welfare programs cannot function properly unless they are being used to provide financial assistance to those who are actually struggling financially, which is not always the case. \n\nThat said, you seem to be making a mistake when you talk about \"getting rid of\" welfare.

Reddit posts seem to use the banana as a method of portraying scale and it seems to me that this is a poor way of doing so, for the following reasons:\n\n1) a bannana is not a uniform size. There are large bananas and small bananas\n\n2) The curve. Bananas are not usually straight. This makes judging their length difficult. It can also mean that it is hard to show the banana very close to the object you are scaling against.\n\n3) Bananas are relatively small, this makes them bad for judging the scale of larger objects. This is especially bad when considered in conjunction with point 1, as any difference between the percieved size of a banana and the actual size will be enhanced for an object many times the size of the banana. \n\n4) Bananas are perishable. This means that it is unreasonable to expect a redditor to have them on hand at all times. I for one do not at present own a banana as being a poor student living alone I cannon afford a fully equiped fruit collection, I only own at most 2 types at a time (at present I own apples and pears). \n\n5) Bananas are relatively large. This may conflict with point 3, but the point is that when scaling small objects (pins, hair ect) then a banana is too large, meaning that in order to use one for scale you would either need to show only a small amount of the banana (therefore making it fairly useless for judging scale) or you would need to 'zoom out' in order to show the entire banana thus making the object less visible and therefore harder to judge scale. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So if you wanted to describe something, say a book, you might want to describe its shape, its thickness, its weight, etc.  But when you look at a banana you are not describing its shape, thickness, weight or anything else about it.  If you were to take a book and put it on a banana, it would probably fall off the banana.  Even if you could fit it in a banana, it wouldn't fit perfectly because there was no room for the thick part of the book inside of the banana.  So what does this suggest?  That we shouldn't use the same method to represent things in the real world.  And why isn't it better to use the same method to represent things in the real world?

I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them.

The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: **THE NAME YOUR PRICE SCHEME**  \n\nSo this idea would radically restructure employment as we know it today. In simplest terms, here's how it would work:  \n\n1. Every two years, you cast a vote by writing in the wage you would like to receive for the next two years. The figure you write in becomes your *actual* salary, unless your write-in is below the minimum wage (see below). You effectively name your price for two years (assuming you can find an employer willing to pay you that price).  \n\n2. The national average of all the votes becomes the new legal minimum wage. This is the salary you'll receive if you a) enter the labor market without having voted previously, or b) voted yourself a salary below the minimum wage, in which case your salary would be raised to the legal minimum.  \n\n3. Unemployment insurance (and social security benefits/pensions) will be expanded to cover the unemployment, if any, caused by higher labor costs. For the first 6 months, unemployment will pay the full minimum wage. Every 6 month period after that, unemployment benefits will be reduced by 6.25%, steadily increasing the incentive to find work. You can volunteer at any time to forego your elected salary and accept the minimum wage, if that helps you find work. Excess unemployment insurance will be financed by a surtax on high-bracket incomes, capital gains and corporate taxes.  \n\n4. GDP adjustment. All salaries \u2013 regular, minimum wage, unemployment &amp; pension benefits \u2013 are subject to GDP adjustment. If the sum total of write-in salaries turns out to be larger than total annual GDP, reductions would have to be made. Similarly, if total salaries are far lower than GDP, they would be adjusted upwards. The exact adjustment would need some fine-tuning... salaries obviously can't be 100% of GDP, but I'm not sure what their ideal or natural ratio to GDP should be. Or maybe GDP adjustment is a bad idea. This part is complicated and a little above my pay grade.  \n\n5. Inflation adjustment. All salaries would be indexed to inflation, incremented (or lowered) annually.  \n\n**DISCUSSION**  \n\nHere's why I thi\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; But I'm not convinced. \n\nWell, there is one thing that makes me think so. \n\nYou've already said that the lowest rate of unemployment benefit would increase the incentive to find work. If you don't get the job you want because of the low rates, then you're more likely to take another job with a lower rate. That means you won't lose money from taking a second job, but you also won't earn a higher rate for doing so. So you'd end up earning less, but you're not losing any money. \n\nThis is exactly why I think the system could be improved. It seems to me that the people who are currently getting the most money are the ones who are unemployed right now. And even if they were getting paid the minimum wage, they wouldn't be able to buy the same things as someone who was working for $70/hr. \n\nAnd I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. The fact that everyone gets the minimum wage doesn't mean that everyone has equal access to education and healthcare. Even if everyone had the same minimum wage, many wouldn't be able to afford those things. There might be a few people who do manage to make ends meet, but there are millions of people who are stuck", "rejected": "&gt;I think that's great, but I feel like I'd be better off with a system where everyone has access to a government-funded job placement service for people who want to go back into the workforce. \n\nThat makes sense - it would create a more efficient system of employment. But let's assume you don't want one. I don't see any way that the state could possibly make a good-enough system that would allow everyone to get hired. It would also require a lot of money. And even if it did exist, the state wouldn't actually have enough jobs to fill all these openings. There are always going to be more people looking for jobs than there are places to hire them, so the system just won't work.\n\nYou can imagine a system that would work really well, but isn't feasible because:\n\n1. It requires a huge amount of money. A state-run system would probably cost billions.\n2. It requires lots of workers to live in a single place.

First off, abortion is a legal issue in every single state in the US. That means it will always have a chance to succeed because there are lots of places where they still do it. Second, reproductive rights aren't an issue in your area, but in the vast majority of the world - the reason why people vote for Republicans is because they oppose abortion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But you are also voting for something that has nothing to do with reproductive health. \n\nI agree that abortion is a legal issue in every single state in the US. This is true, however, that many states do not even recognize it legally. So I think you're right, that while it may seem like a legal issue in your area, it isn't. In fact, it's a completely non-existent issue.\n\nIn terms of reproductive rights, I think you're missing the point completely. If you support the right to abortion, then you're supporting the right to contraception too. And since you're pro-choice, that means you're pro-life too.

If the government wanted to stop abortion they'd probably give those two brothers up to someone else.\n\nYou seem to be saying that if I had children because of abortion I wouldn't want them.  That's a big deal.  But the problem here is that there's no guarantee that those kids will actually be healthy and happy.

While my view did not undergo a radical change, I have a new persective on this topic. While I still believe that it is MY right to decide when to die, I have realized that this view I hold is most likely due to my mental illness (depression and BPD). Therefore, I can't fully claim that my view is 100% correct, due to the fact that mental illness tends to cloud rational thinking. Thank you again for all of your responses. \n\nI  have been thinking about this for a while, and I'm completely dead set on my opinion. My opinion is that if you are an adult, you should have the right to decide when/how you will die, and my opinion extends to suicide. However, my opinion is causing me pain, and I am 100% open on having my view changed. Unfortunately, I just haven't heard good enough arguments that have changed my view. Before I go any further, I just want to thank anyone who will contribute to this.\n\nI am a 22 year old female who recently attempted suicide in December of 2014. For all of 2014, I was depressed. I am not talking about feeling \"sad\" or \"having the blues\". I am talking about depression that physically hurts. The worst part about it is that my depression often times came on for NO reason (I could be having fun and then all of a sudden, my depression hits). Unfortunately, I was brought to the ER after my attempt. If I wasn't found, I would have died. Since my attempt, I have been dealing with a lot more depression. This is my final attempt to try to change my view about \"the right to die\". Below are my reasons why I hold this view.\n\n* In society, we get to chose a lot of things. Especially in Western cultures that value individuality, many (even most) get to chose if they will go to college, if they will marry, if they will have kids, etc. However, suicide is not considered one of our rights.

I don't know what it means to me. \n\n&gt; Suicide isn't a personal choice. It has consequences. There aren't many people who choose to die, but some people choose suicide. \n\nThis is true, but even though someone might have a suicide plan, there is always a risk that they won't follow through with their plan. As such, suicide is something that I don't personally agree with. \n\n&gt; Suicide is also a legal option. \n\nThis is actually true, but I still don't understand how this applies to me. I have never committed suicide before, so I have never had to consider this issue from an emotional standpoint. \n\n&gt; I've seen many people who have tried to commit suicide, which is sad, but I see it as something that doesn't happen to me because I have been diagnosed with depression. \n\nYes, this is true, but I don't see anything wrong with the idea that some people might", "rejected": "&gt; But what about the people who don't die as a result of their depression?\n\nI've never really thought about this, but I think that if someone doesn't die because of their depression, then maybe they shouldn't be held responsible for it.

As long as they didn't commit suicide, then I think it's okay that they aren't punished. I think the best thing that can happen is that someone else gets to choose whether or not they will end up committing suicide, and that choice belongs to them, not me.\n\n&gt; So you're saying that you don't believe that there are two different kinds of suicides?\n\nI don't believe that there are two types of suicides. There are only two types of suicides. One is where the person commits suicide by themselves, which is called \"self-suicide\", and the other is where the person kills someone else, which is called \"assault\".\n\n&gt; So if you believe that suicide is not a right, why are you holding onto the idea that suicide isn't a right?\n\nBecause", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_31kfkt", "utterance_id": "t1_cq2iwml", "response_tokens": 199, "context_tokens": 467, "grader": "human", "preference": "1", "is_equal": false}}

Zero is just another concept and not a quantity itself. In your example, I could have written down a million zeros but still have only one million dollars. The number of zeros doesn't equal the amount of money. \n\nThat's what zero does for me. It's just another symbol that we use to help us communicate things without having to say the exact quantity out loud. As long as we're communicating effectively, zero is fine. \n\n&gt; And yet I don't understand why zero is considered to be a real number. \n\nBecause it is a symbol. Symbolic representations are different from physical objects and are therefore considered to be \"real\". This means that we can talk about symbols even though we know their physical form.\n\nThe reason zero is considered a \"symbol\" is that it represents a number that cannot exist physically. It's a number that exists within our minds and allows us to communicate. We call that number zero. Because it's a symbolic representation, it also doesn't actually exist physically, which is why zero is often called a \"number.\" It's just a symbol. Symbols allow us to express ideas and thoughts", "rejected": "&gt;So what is your definition of infinity? \n\nYou defined it as something that is not quantifiable. So there is no meaning to it. The only reason we define it as a number is so that we don't have to use the word infinity.\n\nBut I think you're absolutely correct. Infinity is just another name for something that isn't measurable. So whatever we call it, it doesn't have any real meaning unless we choose to give it one. So I guess I'll just stop calling it \"infinite\". \n\nEdit: I agree with this. There really is no difference between \"infinity\" and \"indefinite\" in mathematics.

Her response suggests that there's nothing atypical about being genderqueer when there obviously is.  There's nothing wrong with being genderqueer, just like there's nothing wrong with having red hair or being an astronaut, but it is atypical; someone may be surprised to learn this about another person.\n\nTo me, this just seems like a reason to put typical people on the defensive when they broach the topic of gender studies.\n\nChange my view.\n\nEdit #1:\nAt this point, I'm just deciding who to give a delta to.  A medical journal headline reading \"New results from a study on Japanese nonheternormative behavior,\" clearly couldn't use the word typical in the same way.

Since this is basically all contexts where it's relevant, and represents all contexts where I've ever actually heard it used, you can understand my predelta opinion.\n\n     The word seems to convey an attitude that LGBT persons have any reason to be offended when people call them unusual.\n\n     The word requires, in most cases, about the same amount of context as atypical.\n\nEdit #2: the delta post is very hard to find because of,  I suspect,  the downvoting of parent posts.

It's true that we often use \"typical\" to talk about how some group of people behave, but that doesn't make those people themselves. They are just a subset of the general population - they are not unique. In fact, it's possible for a person to be both a member of a subgroup and a member of another subgroup (e.g., a man and a woman), which means that no two members of the same subgroup can be considered \"the same.\" \n\nBut even if we were willing to accept that the terms are misleading, it's still unclear why they exist. Why bother giving such vague labels? After all, our brains aren't wired to categorize every single thing into a specific set of categories. So it's reasonable to wonder why anyone would want to give us labels that aren't useful for identifying the things we're interested in. \n\nOne potential answer is that the labels help us identify groups more easily.

And if it's typical to you, then you'd say it's typical, even if it's not typical for your friends.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks - that's their prerogative.\n\n&gt;The difference between typical and atypical is that people are expected to fit into certain categories.

I stand libertarian overall (my own brand, the government shouldn't be doing things like regulating or subsidizing farming, and has no right to legislate marriage or drug laws). As such, I tend to favor \"conservative\" candidates (in Northern California, the \"right\" is still pretty damn far left), but our region and state is strongly blue. This means that in basically any election my vote doesn't matter (might tip it from 65-45 to 64.99-45.01). Furthermore, since California has 38.8 million people, with 55 electoral college votes, and Wyoming has 584,000 people and 3 votes. This means my vote is worth 0.00000141752 electoral college votes (in reality 0 since California is always blue) , while a Wyoming vote is worth 0.00000513698 electoral college votes, or about 4x my vote's value. I feel that in the OLD OLD times, votes actually mattered because we elected supposedly intelligent and wise people to vote for us, whereas now I'm stuck with my vote getting washed out by a slew of straight ticket voters who don't know what they're voting for, just the party.\n\n________________________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

States are not democratic enough for the Constitution to allow for them to vote for their representatives \n\nBoth points seem true. However, if I were in an election where there was no democracy at all then the Electoral College would give the majority of power to the states, so why does it make sense for states to use this system when it could also be used for something else? Also, it seems like it's a good idea for the states to use this system because it will prevent some issues that arise from having too much power in the hands of the federal government. \n\nIt's not clear to me how this can happen without creating problems. Perhaps you want to create a system where the states do have a say in the election, but it only applies to those who win. That way, the states get to vote on things they care about, while the rest of the country gets to choose which candidate they want.

While I do reject most of his views, it is inevitable some of his views have rubbed off on me. \n\nThat said, I've only gotten the flu twice in my life (i'm 20) so I do not suffer from it often. On top of that I have some anecdotal events that are in the back of my head when I consider flu shots.\n\n1. growing up I had a neighbor (old neighbor, so probaby old flu shot) who apparently (child memory here, possibly wrong) suffered from a rare muscle disease after getting a flu shot.

The first is that there's always an infection rate associated with the vaccine - meaning that a large portion of those vaccinated will experience a mild reaction, which may or may not be as severe as the actual illness itself.\n\nThe second is that there are two different kinds of vaccines. One is the one that is given orally, where it takes several days for your immune system to develop antibodies. This type is called an intramuscular injection, and is used for children. The other is the one that is given subcutaneously, where it is injected under the skin. This type is called an intradermal injection, and is used for adults. The difference between the two is how long the injection lasts and how many doses you need to take.\n\nSo, let me explain why I think the first part is misleading:\n\nYou say that you are scared because you \"don't get the flu often\", but that's not necessarily true. It's not like you never get sick, and you have to wait for months for the flu shot. Your body can react to the virus quickly enough, so the first time you get the flu, you'll feel pretty good. After that, though, you might still feel sick for weeks, but", "rejected": "&gt; But I'm not worried about the potential side effects\n\nIf you take your time to study up enough, there's no reason to be afraid of those things.  There's a whole bunch of information out there that says these are just *very* unlikely events.  They don't make any sense as a risk at all, since they're not something that can happen for *every single person*.  It's much easier than saying \"This thing isn't worth it because you won't ever get sick.\"  \n\nThe problem with the flu vaccine being useless is that it doesn't help prevent actual infections.  The vaccines work by making you immune to the illness.  Once you get the flu, you'll still get it.  What it does do is teach your body how to fight it off better, which makes it less likely to cause complications.  \n\nThere are a few reasons why this works:\n\n1. Your body already has antibodies ready.  This means that once you get the flu, you'll already have built up some protection against it.  \n2. The virus changes over time, so your body needs to adapt.  With regular vaccination, your body adapts to the new strain of the virus, which means that the vaccine is good at fighting off", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1pcykr", "utterance_id": "t1_cd16k0g", "response_tokens": 395, "context_tokens": 495, "grader": "human", "preference": "1", "is_equal": false}}

My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average - the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nI suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. As the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment. This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place.\n\nStill, despite this - I can't help but get pissed when liberals rag on the native working class as \"Rednecks\" or \"Bogans\" (Or for black people trying to get ahead, \"Uncle Toms\") that supposedly vote against their own best interest by voting to halt immigration.

The second one may be true in some cases, but I feel it is only true if you have never experienced social problems before. If you've had them before then you will not feel the need to change anything. Your opinion about social skills isn't really relevant because you haven't experienced them yourself.\n\nThe third thing you mentioned sounds interesting though.

A lot of people would have a problem with the fact that I identify myself as a nerd for these reasons\n\nThis is correct. My reason for identifying as such was because I could not accept the idea that people were inherently stupid, ignorant, ungrateful and so on. This led me to feel that I couldn't be a part of society unless I was a genius. I found myself feeling uncomfortable around other people who weren't smart like me.

The arguments between these groups seem to arise from an inability of members of the latter group to comprehend someone simply not having the money to purchase all of their games.  \n\nAlso, the problem of piracy in general seems to primarily be a problem in countries with high rates of poverty, such as the US and other third-world countries.  \n\nErgo, it seems evident that people would purchase video games if they could afford to do so without potentially sacrificing something crucial to their survival/comfort (food, water, shelter, etc.).\n\nNote: I am not saying that no one would pirate games if everyone was wealthy.

The biggest problems that face troops don't have to do with supplies, funding, or a lack of training going into the conflict, but their transition back into society afterwards. We train them to go *into* the conflict, why would we not train them to *come out* of it?\n\nIf we **know** that many, many troops struggle with this, and we **know** how to treat it (obviously each case is different, but I mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods), it seems like a no brain-er that we should be doing something about it. In my mind, the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return.

My main point was that it would take a very long time for these guys to come back from combat. \n\n&gt; I think your argument has merit though. For instance, the U.S. military actually has a system called \"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\" They call it PSTD, which stands for \"Psychological Stress Disorder,\" because it's more than just being scared. PSTD includes symptoms such as anxiety, hyper-vigilance, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and thoughts of suicide. As you mentioned, the military uses various methods to help soldiers deal with these issues. However, it doesn't make sense to assume that the people who are suffering from PSTD are going to come back from war mentally intact.\n\nThat's true, but I don't think the military would want to use any of their existing resources on someone who might suffer from PSTD in the future.

They weren't combatants themselves, but were affected by the war and its aftermath. \n\nI'm sorry, but I'm not sure how that applies to the situation of the soldier. As someone who has been through the military, I can say that there are a number of veterans who feel like they have more responsibility than they deserve. Their families and friends expect them to lead the family's life while the soldier serves his country. This expectation is based on the assumption that the soldier is capable of leading the family's life without needing any kind of professional guidance or support.\n\nAs far as mental health goes, there are plenty of articles that tell us to be aware of our own emotions, and to seek support if necessary.

While three or four dollars is not much money on its own, the entertainment value of the product, in my experience, not worth the amount I pay. I'll use an example.\n\nRecently, I bought the first issue of the new Ms. Marvel series at $2.99. In it, there were 20 pages of story and it took me about 10-15 minutes maybe to read through the whole book. There were about four scenes in the book (the store, the house, the party, and Kamala gaining her powers), all of which served to introduce Kamala, but little else. While the narrative was entertaining, it stopped the moment it began to develop, leaving a hook for the reader to dish out an additional three dollars to further the story.\n\nConversely, a film ticket may cost about three times as much  (about seven-ten dollars depending on where and when you buy the ticket), but for that price you're getting at least an hour and a half of entertainment with a full three act story. [A book can cost between five to twenty dollars, but for that price you're getting at least several hours worth of entertainment.](http://www.slj.com/2013/06/research/sljs-average-book-prices-2013/#_).

Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.  When a student excels in school, then, employers correctly infer that he's likely to be a good worker.  What precisely did he study?  What did he learn how to do?  Mere details.  As long as you were a good student, employers surmise that you'll quickly learn what you need to know on the job.\n\n\nObviously this applies to some fields more than others.  Med school is not just signaling.  But for most degrees, especially outside of hard science, I think the signaling model is persuasive.\n\n**EDIT 1**\n\nEdit to clarify based on a question below.

I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  \n\n&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  \n4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  \n5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  \n10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, \"driver\" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  \n15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   \n  \nBy the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.

I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work\n\nI'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:\n\n* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.\n* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters\n* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well\n\nI'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done.

It seems to me that as far as I can tell, the proportion of female leads in games is fairly consistent across different genres, even if it varies somewhat depending on genre, platform, and content. I'd expect that the proportions of male leads would be slightly higher than the proportion of female leads, but that doesn't seem to happen. In fact, the opposite seems to be true: the proportion of female leads seems to be increasing, while the proportion of male leads has dropped significantly.\n\nNow, I know that the number of females playing games is smaller than the number of males, which means that the proportion of male leads is less than the proportion of female leads. This is not surprising, since the vast majority of female players are male, and the vast majority of male players are female. But this is still a significant difference - at least 20% of the total player population seems to be male. \n\nIn order to understand what's happening, we need to look at the proportion of female leads", "rejected": "&gt; I'm not going to weight in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just.

I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these.  I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it.  It allows them to be a \"victim\".  I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond.  Aside from that, cyberbullying is even more BS.  Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a \"nice\" place.  It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel. At that point, it is literally JUST WORDS on a screen.  You can delete posts, block phone numbers, delete accounts...so many more ways to just \"walk away\".  Which is exactly what I and many others did when bullied in person.  \n\nEdit:  Great discussion everyone!  Thanks for all your input!\n\nComment 1: I don't know your age, but there is one thing that you may not have considered: Things aren't the same as they were when you were growing up. You say that we shouldn't be babying these kids who are victims of bullying. Did you feel that way when you were being picked on? Or did you wish someone would do something to stop it? What tools did you have to respond with? What tools do you think these kids should be given so that they won't be victimized? I mean, we have laws to protect adults from harassment... Why do you feel that children deserve anything less? \n\nAs far as Cyberbullying: It is easy to run away from a bully in person (which is what you say you did). It's a lot harder to get away when those bullies can track you to your home. Can harass you at an time of day or night. Can torment you from anywhere on the planet, regardless of where you are.

They need help getting over themselves, which means knowing how to stand up for yourself and not just accept things like bullying as part of their life.\n\nI agree that this helps.  My problem with cyberbullying is that it makes the situation worse by making the child feel like their personal space is invaded, that they are a target, that they have nothing left to lose.  The child feels like their world is being torn apart and the only hope they have is to retreat into their own little corner.  This leads to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem because the child feels like he/she isn't good enough.  Because of this, the child doesn't want to tell anyone about the bullying or try to change their behavior.  And if they do try to change their behavior, it feels like they're failing or failing miserably.  So instead of changing their behavior, they just continue to suffer from the negative effects of the bullying.  That's why I think it's better to give the child some sort of coping mechanism for dealing with the negative effects of the bullying.

His actions allowed him to see things in a new light that he didn't know existed before, and he used those insights to make a change. \n\nThe fact that it was a good idea is also important to consider, even if it wasn't immediately obvious at the time. There is a reason why Winston chose to go on the run after all these years, and it is not simply that he wanted to escape. There was something about the world he knew, and the people who lived there that made him want to leave. This isn't necessarily an indication that he had never liked the world before, but it certainly makes it less likely that he would choose to stay forever.

Fuck everyone who thinks they're making a point with it. There is no logic in it - it's used to demean the subject, insult intelligence, and attempt to guilt the 'offending' party. It's myopic, callous, and condescending.\n\nNo one should feel guilty for being themselves. Ever. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being part of the majority, well that's life. I shouldn't have to explain that the majority of people are in a majority, that seems redundant - but these 'arguments' are always phrased as if that isn't the case. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being a minority, that's also life. \n\nThe arguments assume that the subject is incapable of empathy, and is actively attempting to hold to these 'privileges' and keep them away from everyone else. That's simply not the case. Yes, white men can walk safely down the streets in the suburbs, black men don't need to lock their doors when they roll through the ghetto, women aren't seen as creepy when they ask someone out - *good*, why is this a bad thing? In an ideal world, everyone would feel safe walking or driving in any part of town at any time, and no one would be treated as a creeper for expressing interest in another, and so forth. This isn't an ideal world - that may suck when situations where we don't have such 'privilege' are encountered, but that's life. \n\nWorse, these arguments require, by necessity, the outlook of a societal parasite. Rather than working to change things or make their own situation better, these people want to shame others for what they themselves don't have. As if screeching shrilly at someone that they should feel bad for being who they are, is somehow a morally superior stance.\n\n**edit:** View changed.

The issue is that the definition of privilege has been constructed over time to include only some types of privileges. Privilege does not have to mean something negative, it could just be a neutral term. To use \"privilege\" to mean good for everyone is like using \"lack of understanding\" to mean lack of knowledge. A word can have many definitions and meanings, depending on how it is used.\n\nI think it's important to note that most of the comments that followed the post were about privilege and how it impacts individuals, not society. People often refer to society as having \"privileges\", which is true because all members of society have access to certain rights and benefits, but that doesn't make the society itself privileged. Privilege is an abstract concept that applies only to specific groups of people within a society. It doesn't apply to all members of a society, nor do its members.\n\nI am not a political theorist, but my impression is that privilege is used more in a moralistic sense to justify actions that are considered unjustified.

If you take care of it properly, you're saving water over the long term. \n\nHowever, it still won't be perfect. You'll need to clean up after yourself too, and keep the water off until you're completely dry, which may take some time depending on how much urine you're generating at once. \n\nThe best way would probably be to have someone else help you.

Lemme capture this complicated topic in bullet points.\n\n* Gandhi's most fundamental idea was that to achieve right ~~means~~ ends, we must use right ~~ends~~ means. Liberty and peace being right and noble ends, require that we use peaceful means to achieve them. A violent action to achieve his means was very heavily opposed by Gandhi.\n\n* Gandhi suspended one of the most successful movements in India against the british called [Non-cooperation movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement)(launched in response to [Jaliahwalah Bagh Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre) in which 1300 people died), purely because in one small town of India a bunch of protesters torched a whole police station killing 22 police officers.\n\n* This action disappointed numerous people but it gave a very clear message to people all across India. Those who wanted to join him into the struggle, the message was clear regarding the importance of \"means\" to achieve the ends.

It was a political act. \n\nYou are absolutely correct, the actions were bad. The problem lies elsewhere. When people get into trouble they are usually justified for taking the actions that they take. \n\nThe reason why Gandhi is still considered as one of the greatest leaders in history is that when people got into trouble, instead of justifying themselves for doing things they didn't like, they said \"this is what you should have done\", \"let me help you out\". That is the essence of Gandhi's leadership.\n\nThe main thing is that Gandhi used the actions he took in protest against the British to fight for freedom. If we look at his books, he clearly stated that it is not necessary to fight against the British in order to gain independence, that it is possible to win the war through peaceful means. This is also reflected in his famous quote \"We are not fighting for independence but freedom\". \n\nSo there is a big difference between Gandhi's leadership and his politics. His politics is more about the goals and ideals of which he wants to achieve and his leadership is about how he uses those goals to fight for them. This is what makes Gandhi great.

Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species.

The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control.

If you have a company that uses a lot of chemicals, then you're going to get sued for contamination, whether it's done by a human or an animal. These two examples aren't even real, but they illustrate what I mean.\n\nNow, if your company is doing something that is illegal, such as driving a car while intoxicated, then your company would face similar consequences regardless of how many humans work there. It's the same thing with corporate crimes against society. If someone at your company commits a crime against society, they'll be punished no matter who committed it. That's exactly the kind of system we want to implement in America.

Corporations are supposed to be able to make money by doing business, but that does not mean that corporations have the same rights as people. There is nothing wrong with that, but it means that corporations don't have all the same rights as people. I suppose I could argue that corporations are more than two persons, but I don't see how corporations have \"more\" rights than individuals.

The west has deemed men's chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can't expect people to act like your chest is different. \n\n2. The situation.

Therefore it should be seen as a bad thing, and childlike wonder and enthusiasm should be promoted at all stages of life.\n\nComment 1: You're confusing the act with the judgement. Whether or not something is 'dignified' is a value judgement about some act a person is committing, specifically, whether or not that person is worthy of respect for committing that act. What you're really saying here is not that 'dignity' is toxic, but what we consider 'dignified' is toxic, which is to say sometimes our social norms are toxic (which is true).\n\nHowever, dignity can still be a useful concept. If someone does something worthy of respect we can encourage that behavior by calling it dignified. On the other hand, if someone does something bad but not technically *morally wrong*, we might be able to discourage that behavior by calling it undignified. Using the concept of dignity properly is all about properly identifying what should and should not be considered acts worthy of respect.

I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.\n\nBut now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I'm even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.\n\n**1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**\n\nThis should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.)

Personally, though I'm straight, I'd sooner get a sharriage if such a thing existed than a marriage, as I'm atheist.\n\nTwo situations come to mind immediately - what if a gay couple is also religious? And what if one partner in a hetero couple is religious and the other is not?\n\nThe first scenario is a bummer, but I'd have to say that the couple would need to accept that it's their own doctrine that is getting in the way of them getting married in the first place.\n\nThe second scenario is easy. The woman gets her way. Duh.\n\nAlso - This entire view only exists because of how resistant the majority (or at least the majority in power) are to legalize same sex marriage. Obviously it would be preferable to just legalize gay marriage everywhere and be done with it, but if the reason that isn't happening is that God says it's bad, then this seems like an easy workaround to me.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;I think you're confusing two things here.

In this case, society prescribes meaning to a birth precisely every 365 days post-birth. Why? Intrinsically, there is no value in this date. A day is an approximation of the length of time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis with respect to the sun. Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the 24 hour period in which we were born when it occurs 365 days later? A year later, the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day, yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning.\n\n**Sidenote:** I've gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That is exactly what happened when the states were established, so there would be some sort of armed militia. This is a major flaw in the argument. \n\nI am also aware that a lot of countries have armed militias today, but these are not based on the Second Amendment at all. They use different kinds of weapons. In the US, the military has access to a large number of weapons, including machine guns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, etc. However, there is a limit to how many guns a country can afford, and many countries have had trouble getting enough guns to actually make their armies strong enough to deal with threats. \n\nIn addition, most countries are either already militarily powerful, or are very close to being so. Many have been able to achieve this status because of successful wars fought elsewhere, rather than having to build up their own arsenals.

The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on.

I'm suggesting that the problem is that it is often seen as inappropriate. When I post a story online, most people who see it automatically assume it's appropriate. This leads to people thinking that I'm asking them to watch porn, which they may or may not find funny depending on how it's posted.\n\nI don't think that I'm asking people to watch porn, nor do I think that they should watch it. That's not the point. What I'm asking is that people who see this content are likely to be aware that it's inappropriate. They're probably watching it because they like the content, or maybe because they are working late and they feel like they have something interesting to talk about.\n\nThe reason I say it's not the point is because even if someone finds NSFW content amusing, they still won't necessarily take it seriously.

The point is that we have an extremely poor evaluation system now which makes it impossible to even assess what good teaching actually is.  \n\nIn my opinion, the best way to evaluate teachers would be through their own performance as judged by students.  This would require us to have some kind of rating system which allows teachers to rate each student based on their own abilities and strengths.  This can then be used as evidence for the quality of the teacher's instruction. \n\nThere are many different ways this could be done (e.g., using rubrics, standardized tests, etc.), but I'll focus on something simple and obvious.  Imagine if there was a test which assessed the amount of knowledge a student had learned from a book, with the answer key given out before the test.  It would be possible to use this information to judge whether or not the teacher did an excellent job of explaining the material.

Students from middle school to college take a vow of silence in an effort to encourage schools and classmates to address the problem of anti-LGBT behavior by illustrating the silencing effect of bullying and harassment on LGBT students and those perceived to be LGBT.\" The most recent Day of Silence was on the 17th.\n\nI participated in this event multiple times when I was in high school. People generally knew that it was meant to show support for LGBT rights, but not much beyond that. People primarily seemed to use it as a way to avoid having to answer questions in class for one day.\n\nBesides my anecdotal experience, the movement fails logically as well. People's bigoted opinions are not going to be swayed by silence. In order to change people's attitudes towards LGBT* people, everyone needs to speak out about the issue of bullying and harassment, not stay silent about it.\n\nSilence does not speak volumes in this context. People cannot be educated if you are not explaining anything to them. People who bully LGBT* kids aren't going to try to understand why everyone is being silent, and even if they do understand, they aren't going to care.\n\nComment 1: The silence itself does nothing, you're right, but peer pressure is a powerful force, especially at that age, and this is a case where it can be harnessed for some positive impact.\n\nGrowing up where I did, disapproval of homosexuality was \"normal\".  It was just expected that you thought gay people were bad, and no one reacted negatively at all if you went around saying it to anyone who would listen.  \n\nSeeing that that's not the case, that a lot of people DO support gay rights, is a powerful piece of information.  I was never religious, so I didn't get on board with the whole hating gay people thing, but that was a big shock when I got to college, realizing that it was okay to outwardly support gay rights, because *other* people supported it.\n\nSo that's what the day of silence can accomplish.

You have to examine all the various consequences, effects, and repercussions. For a law to be just, it must prevent more harm than it causes; anything but legalization of all drugs (not just decriminalization) fails that test.\n\nPossibly the most popular argument for drug prohibition is due to the social harm caused by drug addiction. Certainly drug addiction does cause social harm, but that harm pales in comparison to what is caused by imprisoning vast swaths of society. Separating families and saddling users and sellers with a permanent black mark that destroys most opportunity for gainful employment and being a productive, contributing member of society is vastly destructive. In short, \"drugs will ruin your life, so we'll punish you for using drugs by ruining your life\" just fails at logic.\n\nThen there's the argument that buying drugs funds criminals and terrorists. Well, no shit, genius. If you don't allow legitimate businesses to sell it, it's going to be the criminals. This gives rise to the black market, which is the source of the vast majority of \"drug related\" crime (only a small portion is comprised of actual intoxication-induced misbehavior). Legalization of the drug trade takes the money out of the hands of gangs and terrorists, and eliminates the black market and its associated crime; this is why mere decriminalization for users is not adequate.\n\nLet's also look at effectiveness. Essentially, there isn't any. Prohibition does not decrease usage rates, which is the primary goal. I've heard the argument that \"at least it increases street prices,\" but this is a terrible argument. Increased prices don't deter use, they just make addiction more financially devastating for addicts (thus increasing, not decreasing harm), and the increased profits just add incentive for criminals to produce/traffic/sell more - and use violence to protect their profits. In short, when you consider the total lack of effectiveness alongside all of the collateral social damage, drug prohibition doesn't actually *do* anything except harm society.\n\nAll in all, any opinion supportin\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;I'm not saying that if people couldn't buy drugs, they wouldn't use them.

But if you think that if people didn't need to use drugs, they wouldn't use them, you're missing the point entirely. \n\nThe problem is that people can't afford to buy drugs without some form of government intervention or regulation. So even if we were able to get rid of the black markets, they'd still exist because of the lack of access to legal drugs. They're simply a way for those who do have access to them to hide from the laws. \n\nIf you're saying that people shouldn't be able to buy drugs, but aren't forced to use them anyway, then you're implicitly agreeing with me. You believe that if we allowed people to freely choose whether or not they want to use drugs, they would use them anyway. But that's just not how it works. We only let people use drugs because they can't otherwise afford to, and since they won't use them anyway, they can't use them legally either. \n\nSo if you're saying that if people couldn't buy drugs, they wouldn't use them, then you're arguing", "rejected": "&gt; But I'm not saying drug prohibition is bad as a policy.

The fact that it is only legal for people who are already addicted to something.  People who aren't addicted may want to use it anyway, but won't because they can't afford it or because they feel guilty about it.  So if someone has a problem, they can buy and take drugs, even if they're not legally allowed to do so.  They're still getting pleasure from it.  \n\n2. The fact that it's only legal for those who are already addicted.  People who are not yet addicted may try to break free of it themselves, which would presumably cost them more time and money than the criminal justice system currently allows.

What I mean by \"leave their families behind\" is simply the idea that they're working somewhere else.  They may not have to leave their homes for a while, but they'll need to travel.  \n\nFor instance, if they're working at the grocery store, they may have to drive around for a while before arriving home.  If they're working at a factory, they may have to commute more often.  The point is that they're forced to work from different places, but there's no way that they can't stay home during those times when they need to be at home. \n\nIn other words, they are making choices based on their own personal circumstances.  It's not something you can force anyone to do.  And the fact that they aren't able to make these choices means that they're forcing themselves to stay home.

Her husband is doing 40 hours a week at his job, but he barely gets by living on the minimum wage, and there's little room for saving. So he can't even afford to pay off his mortgage. She has no choice but to stay home and look after the kids, which costs $150 per month and keeps her out of retirement savings (which she probably shouldn't be). That means her monthly expenses will increase, putting more strain on her finances. It also puts pressure on her to make sure everyone else in the house pays the bills too.

Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement.\n\nThe manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points:\n\n1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking).\n\n2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components.\n\n3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. \n\nWhen we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there.\n\nIt is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency  over a year of driving than an identical hybrid.

It doesn't matter how much battery life they use, if they aren't going to be able to use it fully, they'll be wasting it.\n\nI'm not saying that they shouldn't try to increase their fuel mileage, but they shouldn't waste that potential fuel.  The reason why a car runs so efficiently is because it's constantly moving, accelerating, braking, turning, etc, and that's exactly why it needs that much power.

However, when I look at the numbers, it doesn't work like that. What it does is show that the fuel economy of a car is actually lower than it looks because of the additional load of the battery and electric motors, but also because the cars themselves aren't being driven any differently. If you drive a car and have a regular gas-powered car behind it, then you can see that the electric version is definitely faster, but that the electric model is still going to burn more gas than the gas-powered model. \n\nIn the case of a Prius, the difference between the two models is pretty small,", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1khlm7", "utterance_id": "t1_cbp0hy4", "response_tokens": 650, "context_tokens": 397, "grader": "human", "preference": "1", "is_equal": false}}

There's no one \"uniform\" thing out there, there's an infinite variety of different things, some better than others.  That's why we need to study everything we can get our hands on and understand them, because if we only know how things work in one direction, we won't even know how they work in any other direction.  That's the point of science - studying every aspect of the universe and trying to figure out how everything fits together.  In short, the universe isn't uniform; it's all different, so we need to try to understand it.  So, yes, my view is that we shouldn't assume anything about the way the universe works just because we've seen it in one place.

Your ability to learn and be edified, I feel, is directly hindered by self-confidence.\n\nIn my experience, I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can, and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw, but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.\n\nConsequently, I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith, and quite another to be a fanatic, but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence.

Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation.

The problem is that a fixed price does not provide any protection against the consequences of your actions. In fact, if you go into a traffic ticket, you can walk away from it without losing anything. You don't need to pay the fine. If you want to get arrested for a minor traffic violation, you still have plenty of time to get out of trouble. A fixed price does nothing to prevent you from getting in trouble, even if you are paying a small fine.\n\nThis isn't true only for traffic violations. Any time you go into a parking ticket, a civil penalty, or a property damage fine, there is a chance that you will get in trouble. It's not always likely, but it's possible. As long as you are not caught, you won't suffer penalties because you didn't do something wrong. Even if you did something wrong, you could argue that you weren't aware of your wrongdoing at the time you took the action, which means you weren't fully culpable.

I believe that crowdfunding no matter the reason is stupid. I think it is lazy and a waste of time and money on both the requesting person's part and those who donate money to whatever it is they are sending money towards. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, crowdsourcing is lazy in my opinion. Now in a capitalist society, people start a business with an idea or vision, then fund their ideas with their own personal money, though a few family members or friends may feel free/happy to give some money or help with said business idea. For example if I wanted to open a coffee shop in town, I'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though I wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. With crowdfunding, I feel like you're essentially begging for money via the internet. It's the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. I think if you have an idea and you want to make it happen, you should be get it done yourself without begging your 200 Facebook friends for money. For example, one of my friends that I've known for years decided she wanted to go find the identity of her biological parents. She was adopted as an infant and doesn't know who her biological parents are. So she started a crowdfunding campaign asking for $2,000 to cover the expenses of finding her parents through an adoption agency. If I were in her shoes, I'd never ask for other people's money, I'd pay the bill all by myself instead of asking for money from other people via Facebook.\n\nMy next point is, I think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they're giving money to.

I would argue that it is not a waste of time, but rather, it is the best way to learn about what you're doing. \n\nWhen I started working out, I had to work out every day. Even though it took me a while to realize that I actually enjoyed the workout, there was still a lot of pressure to stay motivated (because we all know how much it takes to achieve results). That kind of pressure comes from feeling guilty because someone else has paid for your workouts and they're telling you to stop exercising. By choosing to exercise, you're making sure that you'll keep improving and feel good about yourself. There's nothing wrong with feeling bad about yourself when you're not doing what you want, just focus on moving forward. \n\nIf you take away the motivation to continue, you won't be", "rejected": "&gt; But what about the people who would actually contribute?  Is there not a large percentage of the population who are willing to put up money?\n\nNo, but when you look at how much money is donated by individual donors, the vast majority of the donations are given by people who don't care enough about the project to even consider the impact that their donation will have. This is because most of these individuals are either single adults who have little disposable income or are young college students looking for a job and need a paycheck. They're not interested in helping the cause because they simply aren't motivated enough. That's why many projects fail - because too many people are unmotivated enough to support the project and not enough people are motivated enough to support it.\n\nI agree that funding projects isn't always easy, but I'm not saying that funding projects is useless. The fact of the matter is, we need more people to volunteer their time and effort into the cause. We also need people to be inspired by our causes to take action. When you see someone else taking action against a problem, it motivates you to take action. People need to be motivated by others before they will take action.

The whole idea of boy/girl and man/woman is just a product of gender roles and stereotypes. You can't be a man (person with a penis) and \"feel\" like a woman simply because you like to shop and play with barbies and wear dresses. You can't be a woman (person with a vagina) and \"feel\" like a man just because you like sports and beer.

In a time when so many are rejecting basic science, it's good to see a TV franchise that can romanticize the actual pursuit of science. My only reservation here is that it doesn't portray a balanced view that would promote sustainability in current behavior practices, making the future look far rosier than it will actually be.\n\nThat said, some of my reservations are on the cultural side of things. Culturally, the Star Trek mantra containing \"...to seek out new life and new civilizations\" is problematic because it suggests a fairly human-centric and ethnocentric view of the universe. The underlying implication is that a civilization is new until humanity meets it. It would have been inappropriate in Columbus' era to call the First Peoples a new civilization simply because Europeans had not yet met them, so it's equally problematic for this mentality to exist in the future.\n\nThe next issue I have is about the gender typing that the show has. While series subsequent to the original series don't exude sexism the way that Kirk's sexcapades did, there are underlying messages that are questionable each series. The majority of the characters are male, and each iteration of the show has some overly sexualized female character.

His friend told him that one is a photograph, one is a painting, and one is a CGI rendering, but you can't tell which is which.

For me personally, I think that's what makes a piece of art great - it feels like a special moment, and it adds a layer of meaning to it.

This is like the Wikipedia article states: \"If the player decides to build [a new invention], he or she must first use the available resources to purchase the necessary materials.\" \n\nSo, if you build a spaceship and some kind of nuclear reactor, the player gets to decide whether or not to use that material to further develop his or her civilization.

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; I think that's what makes psychosis different from normality, in that it seems to me that there is something about how we perceive reality that is at least partially determined by our evolutionarily advantageous traits, and so is somehow related to how our brains have been shaped over time. \n\nWell, you might find the following article [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170645/) interesting.

That's because interest rates are tied to inflation, and inflation hasn't gone down since 1960 either. \n\nIn any case, I don't see any reason to ban interest, and indeed there are reasons why you shouldn't ban it. One thing I can think of is that banks are often run by corrupt individuals who use their position to get loans and kick out people who want to borrow money. But if interest rates went back to the pre-inflation levels, it would mean more people couldn't afford housing or food, which would be bad enough anyway.

Formula isn't as good of nutrition, and should only be neccesary if there is a legitimate health concern where the mother and child can't feed.\n\nOver the course of millions of years, the Mammals have dominated our planet since the Cenozoic age. Our Name, \"mammal\" is a derivative of the word \"mammary\", the Teat gland. We've existed for millions of years feeding off our mother's teats, yet only recently have adopted synthetic formula. Breastmilk s literally biologically built to nurture babies, and It's a fools errand to try and prove that Formula is a better, healthier substitute for breastmilk. (By all means, show me data otherwise, i'm looking to give away a Delt)\n\nFormula isn't as good for baby, and it causes undue financial distress, but unfortunately is easier for new mothers. Breastfeeding is hard work, especially for new mothers, so oftentimes (In America, at least) we abandon hope of breastfeeding and switch to formula within the first day. formula companies stock hospitals and line doctors' pockets in order to rope new, frustrated mothers into the formula easy-train. I feel that this shouldn't be allowed, especially when formula is as expensive as it is.\n\nThe world heath organization says that Children should be breastfed exclusively until 6 months, and should continue to breastfeed with solid food until 2 years. \n\nhttp://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/\n\nIn America, roughly 4/5 of mothers ever try breastfeeding, and only 1/4 of mothers breastfeed until 6 months.\n\n(PDF via CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm)\n\nMy solution is simple: There is an international board that trains and certifies lactation consultants to inernational standards. they exist in America, but in appallingly small numbers.

The first is that your argument is essentially a criticism of the current practice of offering formula to mothers. This is not what my argument is against, because the benefits of breast milk outweigh those of formula. Your second point, however, is that breastfeeding is simply not feasible unless the child is born prematurely, or has some other medical condition which makes it impossible to suckle. \n\nI don't disagree that breast milk is essential for survival, but I do believe that it does not make sense to offer formula to mothers who aren't able to breastfeed, especially if they are pregnant or nursing at the time of birth. As such, I would prefer a public policy that would require formula to be offered by government, rather than just being made available through private companies.  \n\nYou're correct in that breastfeeding is more difficult than formula, but I still think it's important to note that many people in developing countries are not able to afford healthcare, let alone access to the right kind of medical care. In these cases, there's no way around buying formula, but I'd like to see a public policy that allows parents to use whatever resources they can find to provide for their child's needs.

I do agree with what you say, though. The issue comes down to whether or not the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nI understand that there are people who would argue that there aren't any studies showing that Formula is superior to Breast Milk. In fact, many studies have been done comparing both types of milk. While some of these studies have shown that formula does not produce more calories than breast milk, most studies have concluded that the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the cost.\n\nIt might help to know that I am not arguing that Formula is *better* than Breast Milk. That would be too extreme. What I am arguing is that it *isn't* better because it's cheaper to buy Formula than Breast Milk.\n\nSo, if you don't want to read the above link, I'd like to point out one thing:\n\n> \n> According to a recent study by Dr. David J.

Maybe there's something about how they work?  They're so flexible and bendable.\n\nChopstick are extremely flexible and bendable due to the nature of the metal tip which is attached to the handle.  When you hold your chopstick in your hand, it bends and sways slightly depending on how far you lean it.  It also works differently when holding it against your body since you'll need to bend over a little bit and the metal part of the stick sways back and forth.\n\nThe main reason most people use chopsticks is because they make cutting easier.  Chopsticks allow you to cut off small pieces of meat without damaging your fingers by making cuts.  In addition, the amount of force you can exert on a chopstick compared to an ordinary finger makes them an excellent tool for cutting large pieces of meat.  Since chopsticks can cut even larger pieces of meat, they are often used for cooking as well.

I see people indoctrinated by an early age into cults, religions, or any belief system. This seems to counter the idea that we have an in-built guide of how to raise a child. It is unfair that these children should suffer, and be affected for the rest of their life.\n\nWhy should we be allowed to raise a child just because we have the ability to make babies? Or if its considered a moral right, why? In practise, this mean that there should be some sort of test/points system (I couldn't say the best way), to determine if the couple is fit to look after a child. Normally, since abuse is a minority issue, I would say that a blacklist system works better (fit to rear a child until proven otherwise), however, when you are dealing with someone's life, abuse is such a long lasting effect that I suggest a white list system.\n\nEdit: I did not mean to imply eugenics, but I see how it seems I would support it\n\nEdit2: Would just like to say I love you guys, really insightful and provoking stuff, I'll probably find some more of my views I'm not totally comfortable with to post later.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; I do not think that there is a clear line between abuse and parenting and that a blacklisting system is appropriate.\n\nThis is a very broad statement.  Some abusers will not even admit they abuse.  Others may hide their abuser status from others, so there's no easy way to track down the true abuser.  Even if you can identify the abuser, what about the innocent victim who has been raped?  That rape victim might never know that she was abused.  \n\n&gt; But, as you rightly note, it is possible for a parent to commit abuse and yet still be seen as a \"good\" parent. \n\nSo far as I am aware, the only time I've ever known a good parent committing abuse was on TV.  So unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that a parent committed abuse, then you wouldn't necessarily know whether they were acting out of bad intentions or out of guilt over past wrong-doing.  \n\n&gt; The point is that the government does not want parents to have free rein to abuse their kids.  They want them to be held accountable for their actions.  And the only way to hold parents accountable is through a process of screening and vetting them.  \n\nThe problem here is that there is", "rejected": "&gt; But what about the child who is born into an abusive household?\n\nAn abuser can never know exactly how many kids they will take care of, so the first thing you need to do is assess the family situation and see whether they can provide enough time and resources for each child.\n\nThe only exception would be if the family is living in poverty, which is far too common for most families to live in.\n\nYou also need to consider how much money the child needs in order to start school.  If your income is below the median, then you can't afford to pay for the schooling costs.  If it falls below the minimum necessary to cover those costs, you might be able to put off paying them for a while until you're closer to making ends meet.\n\nFinally, you need to think about how many kids are needed to ensure everyone has something they\n...\n&amp;#8710; \nI'm thinking of being able to send the kids to college once they graduate from high school, and having a decent amount of financial security. \n\nThat said, I don't believe that the government should ever be involved in the decision-making process regarding education.

The fact that they feel upset or angry when they look at that person is a symptom of the fact that they are feeling emotional pain.

These two very permanent acts are also two very grim realities that some have to face in their life, even in our modern society.\n\nFinally, my view on offensive humor as a whole:\n\nI would be a hypocrite if I expressed offense to certain jokes. I like to tell jokes dealing with racial stereotypes on the regular. As far as I'm concerned, I am being equally as offensive, and to express distaste to a joke about stuff I don't necessarily like just makes me look like I'm attempting to take a moral high horse.\n\nPeople all laugh at different things, can you convince me maybe they're some they shouldn't?\n\nComment 1: I recommend you take a look at the research involving microaggression.[1]\n\nAs for sexist jokes:\n\n&gt;A study of 73 male undergraduate students by Ford (2007) found that \"sexist humor can promote the behavioral expression of prejudice against women amongst sexist men\".

The speaker is showing ignorance of that the \"sh\" sound is spelled \"sch\" in Germanic languages, and that the structure of the name is \"Roth-schild\", meaning \"red shield\". Its proper pronunciation is along the lines of \"roth-shild\".\n\n- US/English pronunciations of Latin phrases show the speaker's complete ignorance of how sounds are formed in romance languages. I can excuse the inability to pronounce the alveolar trill (rolled R), because it's not easily learned. But this doesn't excuse pronouncing \"a fortiori\" as \"ey for-tay-OR-ey\", when an authentic pronunciation would be \"ah for-tih-OR-ee\". It doesn't excuse pronouncing \"ex ante\" as \"ex AN-tee\" instead of \"ex AN-teh\", \"corpus delicti\" as \"KOR-pus dee-LIK-tay\" instead of \"KOR-pus deh-LIK-tee\", and so on.\n\nHearing US/English speakers pronounce things like that conveys the impression that they want to appear learned, but have done little learning; that their knowledge is superficial, rather than deep.

It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone) \n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem.

I've heard things like \"the pan makes the crust crispier\" (which sounds promising), but I haven't found evidence that I can see supporting that claim.\n\n4) I suppose another question would be whether calzones would have the same appeal outside of Italy.

Let me try and explain why. \n\nIt seems that most of us know what sex means, and we understand what it means in our context, which is probably how you understand it. So, when you say \"sex\", we all recognize it as something physical. That makes sense. However, we also recognize that sometimes it's more than just physical. It's also emotional. For instance, when you take a bath, it feels good. When you have sex, it feels great. When you get married, it feels amazing. All of these things can happen with sex without feeling anything. \n\nSo, sex isn't limited to physical pleasure. We feel emotions too. Em", "rejected": "&gt; I am not saying that every boy/girl want to have sex with every other boy/girl\n\nYou're right, but I disagree. I see two reasons why everyone wants sex with each other:\n\n1. People who are young want sex with people who are younger than them, because they are growing up. This makes sense, because we all want our children to grow into adults. But it also means that we shouldn't expect people to give us sex when we are young (even though they do), and it also means that people shouldn't feel obligated to give us sex when they are young.\n\n2. People who are young want sex with people who are older than them. This makes sense, because we all want to grow up, and we all want to become successful people, so we should be giving each other sex when we are both more capable. But it also means that we shouldn't expect people to give us sex when we are older, and it also means that people shouldn't feel obligated to give us sex when they are older.\n\nSo, what should happen? I think that people should give sex to anyone who is older than them, because we all want to grow up, and we all want to succeed.

This came to mind because as a straight dude, if I hypothetically want to hook up with a hypothetical girl and she has a hypothetical boyfriend, the hypothethical boyfriend might try and fight me although I believe I hypothetically did nothing wrong and all the blame goes on the hypothetical girl for not respecting her hypothetical existing relationships.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But the thing is that I don't know anyone whose relationship is so bad that they can't even make their own choices about what they want to do.

The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow; we do not choose our genes, and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce, a right to bodily autonomy, that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual; no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective, it is *wrong* if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning, and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The 'individual' does not exist; we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control (our genetic code, our upbringing in childhood, the societies in which we live). In turn, our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future, shape the future families and societies. This being realized, it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individual's self-interested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the [invisible hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand). Of course, Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns, which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.\n\nThroughout history we have been shown that in a competitive, individualized society, [that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Which brings me to my point; something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However, such reasons do exist, and they are quite powerful. Among these are:\n\n1.

People have different levels of tolerance for the idea of eugenic policies. \n\nThe more tolerant you are to them, the more likely they are to succeed in their efforts. For example, you could argue that a policy of selective breeding would be best if it were adopted because of the high probability of success. If your tolerance is low, however, then there's a greater chance that the policy would fail. That is why many governments try to convince you that you are wrong. They know that you are very unlikely to support anything that has a significant negative impact on society. \n\nI don't understand how it makes sense to take any action against those who are already suffering from disease or disability, but I am sure that you wouldn't argue with that.

If you take the definition of the word \"evil\" very literally, then you're actually defining \"goodness\" as evil. There is absolutely nothing inherently bad about being an individual - everyone has the potential to be good. And yet, in order to claim that individuals are inherently good, you must first assert that the existence of evil is somehow intrinsically wrong. That would seem to be a circular argument. \n\n&gt; I also feel that the entire concept of eugenics is based on the notion that one can make changes to a population that will result in more desirable traits.\n\nIt doesn't really work that way, as long as your goal is to increase the number of desirable traits within a population, you won't have a problem. Eugenics works by increasing the chances that a certain trait will become more common, not by changing it.

(Only regarding hunting for food) \n\nThis isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit sadistic. Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; But then full of all that respect BOOM! They took its life\n\nYou're right. The killing is brutal, painful and very destructive. It's a waste of lives and resources to just throw them away. If you'd rather just kill them, then by all means do so. But if you really care about their wellbeing, you'll want to keep them alive until you find a way to get rid of them.\n\nIf you'd prefer to leave them alone, then you'd better be able to find another way to feed them before they die.\n\n&gt; And there's no need for it to even hurt them because it's just being a hunter\n\nI suppose I'm not sure how much more cruelty this would cause. Hunting does seem crueler than farming or factory farming. But it still feels good to kill something, so maybe we shouldn't try to eliminate the feeling of satisfaction we get from killing. If that's true then I think the only way to satisfy our hunger for meat will be to increase the number of animals hunted and kill less. This is probably one reason why hunters tend to overhunt and underpopulate the species. The more people there are hunting, the fewer wild ones are left.\n\n&gt; Hunter's love for animals is not necessarily related", "rejected": "&gt;I think this is because there's no inherent right to kill or eat animals. If we want to eat them we're free to do it. If we want to keep them we're free to keep them. If we want to protect them we're free to protect them. If we want to raise them we're free to raise them.\n\nNot true. Not by any means. It's quite common for humans to kill animals which aren't being used for food, clothing, etc. As long as they're not in captivity, the act is still unethical. If you're talking about a species which has been hunted down to extinction, that would be different. In that case you're making up your own ethics, and it might even be morally wrong to continue killing that species. The difference between those two examples is whether the act was intentional, or unintentional.\n\nIn both cases, you're doing something you shouldn't be doing. There's nothing inherently wrong with killing animals for their fur, skin, hides, bones, etc. It's just that you shouldn't be doing it, and if you were, you'd probably be guilty of murder.\n\n&gt;If we want to raise them we're free to raise them\n\nThat's fine.

I registered online and it took 5 minutes.  With a little creativity and some paperwork, I could apply for [tax exemption](http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Churches-&amp;-Religious-Organizations), perhaps by starting a commune?\n\nMy commune would use the same public resources as everyone else.  As a private citizen, away from my organization, I could send my children to public schools, claim welfare benefits, and enjoy the relative protections and upkeep of the state.  Pending how charismatic that I might be, I could have a relatively large compound with surface parking, attracting thousands of visitors, perhaps straining the roads and sewers of the small county that I reside in.  \n\nIt might not be easy to incorporate as a church, and I may be less than sincere, but it is possible.  My special authority on the universe will be difficult to challenge and I might tap into thousands of years of western religious traditions to cement my point.\n\nUltimately, the value that I provide as a church is only moderately questionable as the pretense is difficult to rule upon without infringing on my religion.\n\nIf I paid taxes on my church's earnings, then I would contribute to the quality of services provided by my state.  I would be free to lobby legislative bodies and more fully engage my government as a paying participant.  I could still incorporate as a nonprofit on the clearly defined activities that I participate in which do qualify with measurable purpose, but the effort that I spend reaping souls would be my own enterprise.\n\nIs there reason why church's shouldn't be treated as any other organization?

Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *mar\u012bt\u0101re*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. \n\nNow moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  \n\nNow I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  \n\n[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikiped\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "I think the argument that \"Marriage\" is religious is a little flawed. It's a term that has been used since at least the beginning of Christianity (which started with a priest giving out a marriage certificate).

I don't think there's an argument here against it being religious.\n\nThe fact that it's a term that exists only within the church isn't particularly strong evidence for or against the claim that it is religious. I think it's pretty clear that the majority of Christians would agree that it's not religious. \n\nAs far as my point about the term itself going away, that's true. However, the term isn't being used like that anymore. As long as it's accepted as a religious concept, it will probably be used that way forever. There are some cases where it was used outside of the church, such as in law, but those are exceptions rather than the general case.

Rich people will finance and give so much more opportunities (education, experiences, contacts, influence) to many generations of their offspring, how young people can compete equally so their merit will decide who deserves what and gives the best individuals of a society the top positions!?. Only moral heritage should be valid.\n\nComment 1: I will agree with the important of preventing an aristocratic class from accumulating most of the nation's wealth (oops, too late), but banning inheritance entirely is a mistake for the following reasons:\n\n* Funerals cost money, as does end of life care. These expenses can range up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is unlikely to be available in liquid assets for most, and leaving families on the hook for these costs when the dying person had the physical resources (perhaps a house that could be sold) to pay for it eventually is unethical.\n\n* Sometimes specific items have sentimental value. I own a violin that belonged to my great grandfather at the time he immigrated from Europe to the US, and though it isn't worth much, you can bet that I want to pass it on to my own kids someday. This would not change if the violin were instead worth $100k. Artworks could easily fall into this category while being worth much more.\n\n* Many people who grow up poor and struggle into the middle class do so in part out of a drive to leave their children with more than they had. They want to improve their family's lot. If there is no more material heritage, this drive is eliminated. \n\nIn order to level the playing field and establish a meritocracy, I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on, and, crucially, at the same time provide services for health care, education, and child support through taxes so that even the poorest of children have a real opportunity to succeed. \n\nThe playing field will never truly be equal, because successful parents don't just come with money, but with connections to other successful people. Their children will benefit from these connections regardless of material inheritance, and there's not really anything to do about it.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on\n\nSo if I am a wealthy man, I have no problem with someone giving me a mansion or a beach vacation.

For example, I don't think I could ever fix my car (because I haven't learned how), and I definitely wouldn't be able to fix someone else's car (because I haven't learned how). I think I'm very good at fixing my own problems, and I think I'm capable of helping others fix theirs. But I don't think I'm qualified to teach them how.

This understanding that freedom of speech is \"good while it benefits us, but bad when it doesn't\" is exactly the reason why it must exist, and was the very mechanism that gave us social progress: to allow individuals or minority groups to challenge the group-think of the masses.  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We've spent Billions on AIDs research, but the current pharmaceutical technology we have isn't sophisticated enough to eradicate this disease.

There are several types of infections which spread sexually and it's very difficult to quarantine them all. \n\nSo yes, people with AIDS need to be quarantined.

There's no point in being quarantined when the risk of spreading the disease is too high. \n\nThe idea of \"quarantine\" comes from the military, where troops had to go through a physical separation process in order to fight an enemy. The soldier had to physically separate himself from the rest of the unit before he could be sent back home. It's the same thing with AIDS. If someone is infected, they shouldn't be allowed to infect others, even if they're isolated from the general population. \n\nBut what about those who are already infected? Shouldn't they be isolated from the community to prevent further infection?\n\nAlso, aren't the people who are currently quarantined really sick and potentially contagious?

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: I'll get this out of the way first - I am a man. Let me also say that more than anything else, I believe strongly in the equality of not only the sexes, but races, sexualities, *everything*. I believe that everyone should be equal and I think this should really be common sense. And yet, I cannot bring myself to call myself a feminist. I think my reasoning for this is sound, and yet I constantly see people talk about how horrible anyone who claims to believe in equality yet doesn't use the term \"feminist\" is. This makes me feel horrible, because there is nothing I want more in the world than for everyone to be treated equally. At first I fought against it, trying to argue my position, and I thought that I was doing well, but I just got called names and mocked for it. Now, a lot of people that I respect very much have been recently saying this same thing (\"Feminism IS equality, the terms 'humanist' and 'egalitarian' are misogynist\"), and I've come to think that there simply must be something here I'm not seeing. I'm either overlooking something or being unnecessarily stubborn in a way I can't seem to realize.\n\nBefore that, though, here is why I still believe I am at least partially in the right:\n\n* The word \"feminist\" implies focus on women, just in its name. I don't mind this when used in connection to women's rights - that's what it's for, right?

I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch.

How does it affect your gameplay?\n\nYou're right, it's just not as fun. There's a reason why everyone likes their mouse and keyboard. If someone was going to try out a controller, they'd probably find one that worked better for their specific needs. A keyboard and mouse work great for *most* games. In fact, they work great for most games. It's just that some games are better suited for one or the other, and sometimes they're both good. For example, I love the feel of a keyboard, but I don't like how my mouse feels. So I keep mine in the middle. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy your gaming experience by combining mouse and keyboard, though. Just don't expect them to be perfect. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6198zD4jKCI) might help explain what I meant by \"not perfect.\" Anyway, thanks for pointing out the differences between controllers and mice!

It seems to me that you can't argue against what you believe to be true, even if you find a counterexample. So, you must be convinced by something that you didn't actually prove yourself wrong by. That's what I mean when I say \"you can't argue against what you believe to be true.\"\n\nIf you don't feel like arguing against anything, then maybe you shouldn't bother making claims at all.

All I mean is being able to at some point in my life find a girl to marry who is compatible with me, on terms that are equally respectful to both myself and her.\n\nLet me give a bit of background. I'm a 29 year old successful professional with a full and interesting life. From my point of view (and from taking dating advice), I'd like to think that I have a lot of qualities that women would find attractive. Do you think women are drawn to success or money?

Despite what you'll probably infer from this post (due to the nature of it), I'm actually both confident and modest in real life. And finally, the \"be attractive/don't be unattractive\" dichotomy? Well, I'm certainly not accidentally unattractive -- I'm in great shape, I dress in flattering, fitted clothing, and I take care of my hygiene. As far as \"be attractive\", I'm average, which shouldn't hurt or help me either way. I have my minor flaws in appearance, but so does everyone.\n\nI'm not looking for a supermodel genius. I actually have incredibly low standards, and my friends and family are often concerned at the quality of women I pursue (Are you sure? Are you drunk?). Yet, dating seems like a Sisyphean effort.

Let me also say that more than anything else, I believe strongly in the equality of not only the sexes, but races, sexualities, *everything*. I believe that everyone should be equal and I think this should really be common sense. And yet, I cannot bring myself to call myself a feminist. I think my reasoning for this is sound, and yet I constantly see people talk about how horrible anyone who claims to believe in equality yet doesn't use the term \"feminist\" is. This makes me feel horrible, because there is nothing I want more in the world than for everyone to be treated equally. At first I fought against it, trying to argue my position, and I thought that I was doing well, but I just got called names and mocked for it. Now, a lot of people that I respect very much have been recently saying this same thing (\"Feminism IS equality, the terms 'humanist' and 'egalitarian' are misogynist\"), and I've come to think that there simply must be something here I'm not seeing. I'm either overlooking something or being unnecessarily stubborn in a way I can't seem to realize.\n\nBefore that, though, here is why I still believe I am at least partially in the right:\n\n* The word \"feminist\" implies focus on women, just in its name. I don't mind this when used in connection to women's rights - that's what it's for, right? And I certainly support women's rights, I just don't like the term because it seems to erase the fact that inequality is constant, from both sides. When someone says \"feminism IS the belief in equality for both genders\", they are right, in the technical sense, but by its very nature, feminism only focuses on women's issues. \"Masculinism\" is stupid for the same reason, with the added bonus of devaluing women's issues. I think we need an all-encompassing term, and \"feminism\" does not seem to be it.\n\n* I have also been faced with discrimination from so-called \"feminists\" simply for being a man.

Feminism is not about women's rights.\n\nNo, you're wrong. I didn't mean to imply that feminism wasn't about gender rights, I meant that feminists weren't talking about them. They were talking about men's rights (which isn't even true), which is where the argument starts. But since it's a gender issue, then the definition of feminism has to include it. \n\nBut you're still correct that I should probably define it better, because if it's not about women's rights, then it's never going to be about men's rights either. It's a contradiction.\n\n&gt;The term \"feminist\" implies focus on women, just in its name. I don't mind this when used in connection to women's rights - that's what it's for, right?\n\nThis isn't exactly true. Feminism is focused on men's rights, while some women may not agree with feminism, or may actually think that it's not about women's rights at all.

I don't care if it's 100 years old, it's not a new idea. Feminism is not about gender equality; it's about the fight for equality between men and women, including race, class, sexuality, etc.\n\n&gt; In the past 50 years, feminists have changed the way society thinks about gender roles and relationships, including the idea that male and female roles are not interchangeable. That's not feminism.\n\nNo, no, it isn't feminism, that's masculinity. Men and women are different things, and it would be wrong to say that one is better than the other.\n\n&gt; Gender equality means that every individual should have the same rights as every other individual.

I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch.

I'll admit that if you have a great reason why you think it's better than a keyboard/mouse, then you might still have good reason to choose it over the keyboard/mouse, or vice versa. I'd love to see some research behind your argument. You seem like a smart guy, so I can understand why you may disagree with this one thing.\n\n&gt; I don't want to talk about it because I'm not interested in it either way\n\nI guess I'm just curious how you came up with this conclusion. It seems to me that you can't argue against what you believe to be true, even if you find a counterexample. So, you must be convinced by something that you didn't actually prove yourself wrong by. That's what I mean when I say \"you can't argue against what you believe to be true.\"\n\nIf you don't feel like arguing against anything, then maybe you shouldn't bother making claims at all. Just state your position, and show evidence that you have nothing else to offer. If someone disagrees with you, then they are probably right", "rejected": "&gt; But I'm not sure why you'd want to do it this way. How does it affect your gameplay?\n\nYou're right, it's just not as fun. There's a reason why everyone likes their mouse and keyboard. If someone was going to try out a controller, they'd probably find one that worked better for their specific needs. A keyboard and mouse work great for *most* games. In fact, they work great for most games. It's just that some games are better suited for one or the other, and sometimes they're both good. For example, I love the feel of a keyboard, but I don't like how my mouse feels. So I keep mine in the middle. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy your gaming experience by combining mouse and keyboard, though. Just don't expect them to be perfect. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6198zD4jKCI) might help explain what I meant by \"not perfect.\" Anyway, thanks for pointing out the differences between controllers and mice! I appreciate it.  \n\n&gt; I still don't understand why you think the mouse/mousepad is so inferior.\n\nOk, maybe you're wrong.

For millenia, human survival was dependent on an acute awareness of one's surroundings, and this built in sense does not shut off just because we have developed civilizations and routine.

I don't mean objectification, like \"I can point at any girl on the street and have sex with her because I own her body LOLOL\". I don't even mean \"playing\". All I mean is being able to at some point in my life find a girl to marry who is compatible with me, on terms that are equally respectful to both myself and her.\n\nLet me give a bit of background. I'm a 29 year old successful professional with a full and interesting life. From my point of view (and from taking dating advice), I'd like to think that I have a lot of qualities that women would find attractive. Do you think women are drawn to success or money? I went to a top-5 school, I make money well into the six figures, and I own over $1M worth of real estate. What about creativity or intelligence? Besides singing, I play 2.5 musical instruments, I'm an internationally award winning dancer, I can speak 3 languages fluently, and I can get by in 10 more. Social skills or being an interesting person? I'm exceedingly polite, a good cook and conversationalist, and I have interesting hobbies that I like to share. Despite what you'll probably infer from this post (due to the nature of it), I'm actually both confident and modest in real life. And finally, the \"be attractive/don't be unattractive\" dichotomy? Well, I'm certainly not accidentally unattractive -- I'm in great shape, I dress in flattering, fitted clothing, and I take care of my hygiene. As far as \"be attractive\", I'm average, which shouldn't hurt or help me either way. I have my minor flaws in appearance, but so does everyone.\n\nI'm not looking for a supermodel genius. I actually have incredibly low standards, and my friends and family are often concerned at the quality of women I pursue (Are you sure? Are you drunk?). Yet, dating seems like a Sisyphean effort.
