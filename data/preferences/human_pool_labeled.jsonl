You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt;So what about water?  If you wash with water, you get rid of germs.  So why not wash with water?\n\nThat depends on where you are and who you are. In the U.S., we typically use water. \n\nIf you live outside the U.S., you'll likely only ever use a toilet paper roll or toilet brush when washing yourself. That's fine, it's not a problem. When you need to flush yourself, you'll probably use a bidet. \n\nI would argue that the toilet paper rolls are the way to go for most cases. They're smaller, more versatile, and easier to carry around. Plus, I'd argue that bidets aren't really necessary anymore. The toilet paper roll is just as good, sometimes even better. \n\nBut then again, there are lots of situations where a bidet would be needed. I'm sure someone will disagree with me here, but I'd argue that the toilet paper roll is just as good. \n\n&gt;How do you know you won't have a problem?\n\nThere's a lot of variables involved. For instance, you might not always be able to reach into the bowl with a towel after you finish your shower.

There's even no reason to avoid it when you know it works really well. The problem is that it's so common that we forget how bad it is. I mean, imagine a day where everyone was using disposable toilet paper instead of biodegradable paper towels. That would make me sick. We live in a world where we expect our bathroom hygiene to always be perfect, so we'll never see toilet paper or bidets again.\n\n&gt; Toilet paper has 2500+ different types of fibers\n\nThat's right. There are a lot of different kinds of toilet paper available, but there are only a handful of brands that I personally use. They all work fairly well though. As long as you're not buying them from an unscrupulous seller, they should work fine.\n\n&gt; Toilet paper is made with animal waste, not recycled materials\n\nThis isn't true. Some types of toilet paper contain recycled materials, but most don't. The best type of toilet paper is the kind that comes in recyclable packages.\n\n&gt; Toilet paper is often cut to size\n\nIt's true.
