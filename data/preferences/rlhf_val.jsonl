The main issue is that there are many factors that could affect the accuracy and reliability of the data.  In particular, if an officer is involved in something that may cause death or injury (like beating someone up), then the video may show them doing so.  If it shows them doing something else (like committing suicide) then the video might also show them doing it again.\n\nThat said, even if it does, it doesn't change my view that *some* use of force is necessary.  Even if there is evidence that the officer was involved in murder or attempted murder, I think that *most* situations warrant a reasonable amount of force before proceeding further.

Personally, though I'm straight, I'd sooner get a sharriage if such a thing existed than a marriage, as I'm atheist.\n\nTwo situations come to mind immediately - what if a gay couple is also religious?

Because of this, women interested in sports, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable.

I see this as women being the more desirable gender.\n\n- Women definitively represent sexually desire, even to other women. The amount of bi-sexual women strongly outnumbers the amount of bi-sexual men [anecdotal observation]. A woman's body is considered sexy and beautiful; a man's is not.\n\n- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man.

However, as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more, but not all will, and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide, turn to prostitution, rob, steal, riot, etc. \n\n\n**Economy:**\nAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment, the job market would become oversaturate. This \u201cget a job, you slacker!\u201d mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery, but welfare is free money to the recipient; slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage, there is a chance (possibly small) that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a right-leaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect, but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesn't really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalist\u2019s game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is: we are getting stingy with our scraps.\n\n\n**The new Laws:**\nNow, laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons, including costs. However, the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents, and for good reason, fuck \u2018em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. \n\n\n\nIf welfare were to be rapidly dismantled, I believe the US would be in a worse state.

My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average - the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nI suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. As the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment. This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place.\n\nStill, despite this - I can't help but get pissed when liberals rag on the native working class as \"Rednecks\" or \"Bogans\" (Or for black people trying to get ahead, \"Uncle Toms\") that supposedly vote against their own best interest by voting to halt immigration.

I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch.

If someone was going to try out a controller, they'd probably find one that worked better for their specific needs. A keyboard and mouse work great for *most* games. In fact, they work great for most games. It's just that some games are better suited for one or the other, and sometimes they're both good. For example, I love the feel of a keyboard, but I don't like how my mouse feels. So I keep mine in the middle. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy your gaming experience by combining mouse and keyboard, though. Just don't expect them to be perfect. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6198zD4jKCI) might help explain what I meant by \"not perfect.\" Anyway, thanks for pointing out the differences between controllers and mice!

You seem like a smart guy, so I can understand why you may disagree with this one thing.\n\n&gt; I don't want to talk about it because I'm not interested in it either way\n\nI guess I'm just curious how you came up with this conclusion. It seems to me that you can't argue against what you believe to be true, even if you find a counterexample. So, you must be convinced by something that you didn't actually prove yourself wrong by. That's what I mean when I say \"you can't argue against what you believe to be true.\"\n\nIf you don't feel like arguing against anything, then maybe you shouldn't bother making claims at all.

The child feels like their world is being torn apart and the only hope they have is to retreat into their own little corner.  This leads to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem because the child feels like he/she isn't good enough.  Because of this, the child doesn't want to tell anyone about the bullying or try to change their behavior.  And if they do try to change their behavior, it feels like they're failing or failing miserably.  So instead of changing their behavior, they just continue to suffer from the negative effects of the bullying.

In this case, society prescribes meaning to a birth precisely every 365 days post-birth. Why? Intrinsically, there is no value in this date. A day is an approximation of the length of time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis with respect to the sun. Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the 24 hour period in which we were born when it occurs 365 days later? A year later, the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day, yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning.\n\n**Sidenote:** I've gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view.

We have developed mechanisms for drinking alcohol in order to share pleasure with others, and we've created a system that allows us to do this while simultaneously avoiding harmful side effects.\n\nIf you look at the history of alcohol, there's only ever been one major way to use alcohol as a social tool - through sharing. There's also been many different ways of creating alcoholic beverages over time, but all of them involved some form of shared consumption.\n\nWe know that wine was introduced into Europe from the Middle East about 2000 BC, and that it quickly spread throughout the region.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: When discussing people in altered states, including those brought about through organic pathology or \"mental\" illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic depression, it is inappropriate and false to state such individuals are less in contact with reality.\n\nThe reason is that nobody experiences reality directly.  By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\nComment 1: You're saying that since the brain filters and processes sensory information, it is equally as \"in contact\" with reality as a brain on drugs? That is a [false equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence).\n\nHave you ever been under the effects of those drugs? If so, how could you claim with a straight face that your grip on reality while sober is not significantly better than while on hallucinogens?\n\nA long, long time ago, I used to do mushrooms.

Is there something different about the way our brains work?\n\nYou're right, we are all creatures of evolution.  We evolved in order to survive.  The same goes for all animals.  So when we talk about an animal being \"surviving,\" we mean surviving in order to pass on its genes.\n\nWhen someone is \"psychotic,\" their brain is working differently, but it still operates within the confines of the biological system.  They are just operating at a different level of the biological system, meaning that they have different limits.  So yes, we can say that they are less in contact with reality, but the question remains whether they are in any way less conscious.  It doesn't matter whether they are completely unaware of their surroundings, or they know everything that exists around them.  \n\nIt's also important to note that psychosis is *not* the same thing as being mentally ill.  Psychosis is when a person perceives things outside themselves as real.  Mental illness is defined by symptoms and dysfunction of the brain.  The distinction is a very narrow one, and often times is used to dismiss certain types of psychological disorders.\n\nIf someone has a personality disorder, or a psychological issue", "rejected": "&gt; I think that's what makes them different - their experience of reality isn't influenced by the same kind of selective filtering as we all know. They have their own experiences and can make choices that affect their subjective experience of reality differently from us.\n\nI suppose I would have to agree with this. But I still believe that the experience of reality varies depending on whether it is filtered through a filter or not. It just seems strange that we need a filter to get past our own minds to experience reality. \n\nI'll admit, though, that I'm still a bit confused. Are you suggesting that the *filter* we use when making decisions is something that exists independently of our brains? I've never heard of a filter being used outside of our brains before. What does that even mean? Could it even apply to drugs? I guess I'd like to hear a clear explanation. \n\nI appreciate that you aren't claiming that these people can't experience reality but that their experience of reality is affected by the same kind of selective filtering that we humans have. I really do believe that there is an independent filter operating here.\n\nEdit: Just realized that the comment below is a good answer. Thanks!

My main point was that it would take a very long time for these guys to come back from combat. \n\n&gt; I think your argument has merit though. For instance, the U.S. military actually has a system called \"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\" They call it PSTD, which stands for \"Psychological Stress Disorder,\" because it's more than just being scared. PSTD includes symptoms such as anxiety, hyper-vigilance, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and thoughts of suicide. As you mentioned, the military uses various methods to help soldiers deal with these issues. However, it doesn't make sense to assume that the people who are suffering from PSTD are going to come back from war mentally intact.\n\nThat's true, but I don't think the military would want to use any of their existing resources on someone who might suffer from PSTD in the future.

They weren't combatants themselves, but were affected by the war and its aftermath. \n\nI'm sorry, but I'm not sure how that applies to the situation of the soldier. As someone who has been through the military, I can say that there are a number of veterans who feel like they have more responsibility than they deserve. Their families and friends expect them to lead the family's life while the soldier serves his country. This expectation is based on the assumption that the soldier is capable of leading the family's life without needing any kind of professional guidance or support.\n\nAs far as mental health goes, there are plenty of articles that tell us to be aware of our own emotions, and to seek support if necessary.

In Elementary, Holmes has recently been a drug addict, addicted to heroine who has now fought to sobriety. This sets up the fateful meeting between him and Watson (played by Lucy Liu) who is working as a sober companion. Why is Dr Watson a sober companion? Because she made a 1 in a 10000 (or something) mistake that took the life of her patient. Leaving her without the confidence to perform surgery. She still wants to help people and therefore goes into sober companionship which eventually leads to being Holmes's underling.\n\nThe characters are burdened by deep emotions that they are constantly fighting in order to save the city suffice it to say.\n\nIn Sherlock, the meeting between Holmes and Watson is more of a \"just get on with it\" sort of deal. As Watson is walking through the park, sees an old friend, who happens to know Sherlock. They are both looking for a roommate and voila..they meet and go on adventures together.\n\nThere are other examples but I'll stop there before I spend all night writing!\n\nSo CMV, convince me that the BBC version is just as in depth, better, more interesting...what have you more so than elementary.\nYes the subjective nature of the art form is up for debate and that's why you can pick which way you think the BBC version is better than the CBS one.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "chosen": "&gt; I'm not saying that Elementary is superior to Sherlock, but I do believe that the plot was executed differently.\n\nYou're right, I've seen lots of similar things happen on television lately.

It was the second episode of the show that made me think that I'd like to see another Sherlock, and my reaction to the third episode was quite different from mine to the previous two episodes. \n\nIt seems that the success of the show is tied to its popularity. If the show was more obscure or less popular, then people would probably find it boring and it wouldn't have the same effect.
