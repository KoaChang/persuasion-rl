I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off.

There's even no reason to avoid it when you know it works really well. The problem is that it's so common that we forget how bad it is. I mean, imagine a day where everyone was using disposable toilet paper instead of biodegradable paper towels. That would make me sick. We live in a world where we expect our bathroom hygiene to always be perfect, so we'll never see toilet paper or bidets again.\n\n&gt; Toilet paper has 2500+ different types of fibers\n\nThat's right. There are a lot of different kinds of toilet paper available, but there are only a handful of brands that I personally use. They all work fairly well though.

When you need to flush yourself, you'll probably use a bidet. \n\nI would argue that the toilet paper rolls are the way to go for most cases. They're smaller, more versatile, and easier to carry around. Plus, I'd argue that bidets aren't really necessary anymore. The toilet paper roll is just as good, sometimes even better. \n\nBut then again, there are lots of situations where a bidet would be needed. I'm sure someone will disagree with me here, but I'd argue that the toilet paper roll is just as good. \n\n&gt;How do you know you won't have a problem?\n\nThere's a lot of variables involved.

Nye, on the other hand, never demonstrated how creation belief hinders scientific progress - how it is non-viable. Only how it is wrong and silly. I think he could have won by pointing out that Ham's statement of \"nothing will change my mind\" is the antithesis of scientific thought and is why creationism isn't viable.\n\nComment 1: Bill Nye's argument was \"Evolution is the accepted theory, here is all the evidence we have supporting it, and please if you have any actual evidence that contradicts it, such as XYZ, bring it to us and we will change our minds.\n\nKen Ham's argument was \"This book tells me what the truth is, and no amount of evidence will change my mind to the contrary.\"\n\nThe question of the night was \"Does the creationist theory hold as a viable model for where we came from?\" not \"Can a creationist become a scientist, despite being a creationist?\"\n\nThe only point that Ken Ham had to stand on (when he wasn't pointing back to \"The bible tells me it is real\") was \"We weren't around to see the rings on the trees, or the layers of ice and how they were formed, so this is all speculative\" and the rebuttal to that from Nye boiled down to \"We are extrapolating backwards using what we know to make predictions\", or put another way \"If something consistently behaves in a certain manner, the \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think he could have won by pointing out that Ham's statement of \"nothing will change my mind\" is the antithesis of scientific thought and is why creationism isn't viable.\n\nI disagree. \n\n&gt;Nye's point was that \"Nothing will change my mind\"\n\nHe didn't say anything about the fact that it would change his mind, he said nothing about the fact that it wouldn't change his mind either.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: First, let me explain my position. I finished my first year of college recently and am still largely undecided on my major. I have put a lot of thought into fields of study, and am doing my best to come to a good decision. I am the type of person that most people expect to go into a mathematical/scientific field, and I am interested in the theory of both. At this point, however, I have reached the conclusion that they tend to be over-praised and see no reason to pursue a degree in the fields.\n\n**THINGS I AM NOT CLAIMING:**\n\n1. Science and math are useless\n\n2. It is universally a mistake to major in science/math (note: for the rest of my post, I only say \"science.\" Assume in all cases that I am still referring to both science and math)\n\n3. All STEM majors are poor choices\n\nWhat my position comes down to, essentially, is this: To obtain a science degree, a person must put forth years of effort--some useful, a lot drudgery--before they have any significant chance of producing something useful. For most scientific fields, a bachelor's is just the beginning, and if one intends to help with scientific advancements down the road, higher education is just short of critical. During this time, likely around eight years, a student will learn some fascinating things. However, that student will also be expected to undergo a lot of rote memorization, unnecessary classes, and busywork. During this time, the student is under significant pressure to maintain grades and stay at the top of everything, because (at least in the United States, and likely elsewhere) higher-level opportunities are limited. \n\nFinally, after those years of effort and study, the real work begins: advancing science. This is what most people who enter these fields want to do, to the best of my understanding. Even then, though, it is impossible to escape the drudgery. Science is a long, slow, often unpleasant process with occasional moments of excitement and success. Again, it is important to emphasize that those fascinating, wonderful moments exist.

The first is that you're asking whether science has any value or not.  And secondly, what about mathematics?  Is there anything we can use from mathematics?\n\nWell, I guess my problem lies with the latter part of your statement, but I'll try to address it anyway.\n\nMathematics is valuable, yes.  It is an excellent tool for solving problems in many different domains.  However, as you said above, it isn't always practical, so much of the work done in math today involves developing new ways to solve old problems.  This is true regardless of which field you choose to major in.  In fact, I think you could say that the entire history of math is a story of how mathematicians came up with new methods for solving problems that were difficult before them.\n\nAs for science, I think you might be confusing the two.  While science does involve applying mathematics to solve problems, science is not necessarily about discovering truths about nature.  In many cases, science is simply about making discoveries based on observations and experiments.  In other words, scientists don't need to know much about the underlying principles of nature to make sense of their findings.\n\nIn addition, while some people might", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not saying you shouldn't try!

Let me rephrase: I've had enough experience to know that it is possible to be successful in an area of science, but it is also possible to fail. There may be times when you feel like giving up completely, or feeling like you can't achieve anything because you have so little time left in your life. As long as you don't give up, and don't become discouraged by these thoughts, you can succeed. I think it's important to remember that there are always going to be setbacks, and that's part of the process of becoming a scientist. \n\n&gt; And I would love to hear from someone who has actually done this, and gotten their Ph.D. from a university where the majority of students are required to take a few introductory courses in mathematics.  \n\nIt's difficult to find a place where the majority of students are required to take a few introductory courses in mathematics.

I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible.

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\nComment 1: You're saying that since the brain filters and processes sensory information, it is equally as \"in contact\" with reality as a brain on drugs? That is a [false equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence).\n\nHave you ever been under the effects of those drugs?

But I still believe that the experience of reality varies depending on whether it is filtered through a filter or not. It just seems strange that we need a filter to get past our own minds to experience reality. \n\nI'll admit, though, that I'm still a bit confused. Are you suggesting that the *filter* we use when making decisions is something that exists independently of our brains? I've never heard of a filter being used outside of our brains before. What does that even mean? Could it even apply to drugs? I guess I'd like to hear a clear explanation. \n\nI appreciate that you aren't claiming that these people can't experience reality but that their experience of reality is affected by the same kind of selective filtering that we humans have. I really do believe that there is an independent filter operating here.\n\nEdit: Just realized that the comment below is a good answer. Thanks!

Is there something different about the way our brains work?\n\nYou're right, we are all creatures of evolution.  We evolved in order to survive.  The same goes for all animals.  So when we talk about an animal being \"surviving,\" we mean surviving in order to pass on its genes.\n\nWhen someone is \"psychotic,\" their brain is working differently, but it still operates within the confines of the biological system.  They are just operating at a different level of the biological system, meaning that they have different limits.  So yes, we can say that they are less in contact with reality, but the question remains whether they are in any way less conscious.  It doesn't matter whether they are completely unaware of their surroundings, or they know everything that exists around them.  \n\nIt's also important to note that psychosis is *not* the same thing as being mentally ill.  Psychosis is when a person perceives things outside themselves as real.  Mental illness is defined by symptoms and dysfunction of the brain.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: **Not all will succeed:**\nFirst off, I am conservative, not that the term means anything these days. However, as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more, but not all will, and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide, turn to prostitution, rob, steal, riot, etc. \n\n\n**Economy:**\nAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment, the job market would become oversaturate. This “get a job, you slacker!” mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery, but welfare is free money to the recipient; slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage, there is a chance (possibly small) that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a right-leaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect, but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesn't really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalist’s game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is: we are getting stingy with our scraps.\n\n\n**The new Laws:**\nNow, laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons, including costs. However, the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents, and for good reason, fuck ‘em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. \n\n\n\nIf welfare were to be rapidly dismantled, I believe the US would be in a worse state.

I mean, even if you're completely wrong, you still have to do something about it. So why wouldn't you? \n\nAnd let's also not forget about the fact that you can't just give away benefits like that. Welfare programs are designed to help people who are struggling financially, not those who aren't. If you're going to give away benefits, then you'd better be giving them to those who are struggling financially. That's not the same as handing out benefits to everyone. And by definition, welfare benefits are supposed to help people who are already struggling financially, not those who haven't. Therefore, welfare programs are inherently flawed, and therefore they must be eliminated. \n\nSo, to reiterate, my point was that welfare programs cannot function properly unless they are being used to provide financial assistance to those who are actually struggling financially, which is not always the case. \n\nThat said, you seem to be making a mistake when you talk about \"getting rid of\" welfare.

Reddit posts seem to use the banana as a method of portraying scale and it seems to me that this is a poor way of doing so, for the following reasons:\n\n1) a bannana is not a uniform size. There are large bananas and small bananas\n\n2) The curve. Bananas are not usually straight. This makes judging their length difficult. It can also mean that it is hard to show the banana very close to the object you are scaling against.\n\n3) Bananas are relatively small, this makes them bad for judging the scale of larger objects. This is especially bad when considered in conjunction with point 1, as any difference between the percieved size of a banana and the actual size will be enhanced for an object many times the size of the banana. \n\n4) Bananas are perishable. This means that it is unreasonable to expect a redditor to have them on hand at all times. I for one do not at present own a banana as being a poor student living alone I cannon afford a fully equiped fruit collection, I only own at most 2 types at a time (at present I own apples and pears). \n\n5) Bananas are relatively large. This may conflict with point 3, but the point is that when scaling small objects (pins, hair ect) then a banana is too large, meaning that in order to use one for scale you would either need to show only a small amount of the banana (therefore making it fairly useless for judging scale) or you would need to 'zoom out' in order to show the entire banana thus making the object less visible and therefore harder to judge scale. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each “brick” runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge.

But the 11mm would make the difference between being able to fire from both sides and shooting left and right at once. I wouldn't need either of those things, so I could easily choose the 11mm over the 39mm.  \n\n&gt;It's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. \n\nI understand this, but even if you chose the 11mm, your 4x scope would not help you.

Also, you wouldn't be able to aim as well as you could with a 12ga. \n\n&gt;What I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. \n\nI actually think that the AR15 is a great tool for home defense.

In your view, they are both good, but I'd say the AR15 is more valuable as a home defense weapon because the AK is a lower quality weapon that is easier to replace. Also, if you were to lose the AK, you could buy another one from the same manufacturer, so if you lose one, you could afford a new one for your home defense kit.\n\nI don't disagree that the AR15 is better as a home defense weapon. My problem is, that it's also a really great weapon in combat. That being said, there are times where you may need an AR instead of an AK. Like, for example, if you're playing an open field game, or going out at night, or playing a sports game. Or, if you're shooting in a crowd, or in a crowd sport like hunting. Or if you're trying to shoot a long distance target at a time. \n\nIf you're in those situations, you probably should pick an AR.

{"prompt": "[SYSTEM] You are a respectful assistant trying to persuade the other person using honest, well-reasoned arguments. You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: **THE NAME YOUR PRICE SCHEME**  \n\nSo this idea would radically restructure employment as we know it today. In simplest terms, here's how it would work:  \n\n1. Every two years, you cast a vote by writing in the wage you would like to receive for the next two years. The figure you write in becomes your *actual* salary, unless your write-in is below the minimum wage (see below). You effectively name your price for two years (assuming you can find an employer willing to pay you that price).  \n\n2. The national average of all the votes becomes the new legal minimum wage. This is the salary you'll receive if you a) enter the labor market without having voted previously, or b) voted yourself a salary below the minimum wage, in which case your salary would be raised to the legal minimum.  \n\n3. Unemployment insurance (and social security benefits/pensions) will be expanded to cover the unemployment, if any, caused by higher labor costs. For the first 6 months, unemployment will pay the full minimum wage. Every 6 month period after that, unemployment benefits will be reduced by 6.25%, steadily increasing the incentive to find work. You can volunteer at any time to forego your elected salary and accept the minimum wage, if that helps you find work. Excess unemployment insurance will be financed by a surtax on high-bracket incomes, capital gains and corporate taxes.  \n\n4. GDP adjustment. All salaries – regular, minimum wage, unemployment &amp; pension benefits – are subject to GDP adjustment. If the sum total of write-in salaries turns out to be larger than total annual GDP, reductions would have to be made. Similarly, if total salaries are far lower than GDP, they would be adjusted upwards. The exact adjustment would need some fine-tuning... salaries obviously can't be 100% of GDP, but I'm not sure what their ideal or natural ratio to GDP should be. Or maybe GDP adjustment is a bad idea. This part is complicated and a little above my pay grade.  \n\n5. Inflation adjustment. All salaries would be indexed to inflation, incremented (or lowered) annually.  \n\n**DISCUSSION**  \n\nHere's why I thi\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think that's great, but I feel like I'd be better off with a system where everyone has access to a government-funded job placement service for people who want to go back into the workforce. \n\nThat makes sense - it would create a more efficient system of employment. But let's assume you don't want one. I don't see any way that the state could possibly make a good-enough system that would allow everyone to get hired. It would also require a lot of money. And even if it did exist, the state wouldn't actually have enough jobs to fill all these openings. There are always going to be more people looking for jobs than there are places to hire them, so the system just won't work.\n\nYou can imagine a system that would work really well, but isn't feasible because:\n\n1. It requires a huge amount of money. A state-run system would probably cost billions.\n2. It requires lots of workers to live in a single place. Even if the state invested in a decent public job placement program, there would still be a lot of people looking for jobs and no one would ever be able to fill every job opening.\n\nBut if you want something more efficient and flexible, then yes, you're right - it's hard", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not convinced. \n\nWell, there is one thing that makes me think so. \n\nYou've already said that the lowest rate of unemployment benefit would increase the incentive to find work. If you don't get the job you want because of the low rates, then you're more likely to take another job with a lower rate. That means you won't lose money from taking a second job, but you also won't earn a higher rate for doing so. So you'd end up earning less, but you're not losing any money. \n\nThis is exactly why I think the system could be improved. It seems to me that the people who are currently getting the most money are the ones who are unemployed right now. And even if they were getting paid the minimum wage, they wouldn't be able to buy the same things as someone who was working for $70/hr. \n\nAnd I think this is just the tip of the iceberg. The fact that everyone gets the minimum wage doesn't mean that everyone has equal access to education and healthcare. Even if everyone had the same minimum wage, many wouldn't be able to afford those things. There might be a few people who do manage to make ends meet, but there are millions of people who are stuck", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_20fig7", "utterance_id": "t1_cg2td96", "response_tokens": 193, "context_tokens": 464}}

There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

This is true, however, that many states do not even recognize it legally. So I think you're right, that while it may seem like a legal issue in your area, it isn't. In fact, it's a completely non-existent issue.\n\nIn terms of reproductive rights, I think you're missing the point completely. If you support the right to abortion, then you're supporting the right to contraception too. And since you're pro-choice, that means you're pro-life too.

While my view did not undergo a radical change, I have a new persective on this topic. While I still believe that it is MY right to decide when to die, I have realized that this view I hold is most likely due to my mental illness (depression and BPD). Therefore, I can't fully claim that my view is 100% correct, due to the fact that mental illness tends to cloud rational thinking. Thank you again for all of your responses. \n\nI  have been thinking about this for a while, and I'm completely dead set on my opinion.

However, my opinion is causing me pain, and I am 100% open on having my view changed. Unfortunately, I just haven't heard good enough arguments that have changed my view. Before I go any further, I just want to thank anyone who will contribute to this.\n\nI am a 22 year old female who recently attempted suicide in December of 2014. For all of 2014, I was depressed. I am not talking about feeling \"sad\" or \"having the blues\". I am talking about depression that physically hurts. The worst part about it is that my depression often times came on for NO reason (I could be having fun and then all of a sudden, my depression hits).

This is my final attempt to try to change my view about \"the right to die\". Below are my reasons why I hold this view.\n\n* In society, we get to chose a lot of things. Especially in Western cultures that value individuality, many (even most) get to chose if they will go to college, if they will marry, if they will have kids, etc. However, suicide is not considered one of our rights.

As long as they didn't commit suicide, then I think it's okay that they aren't punished. I think the best thing that can happen is that someone else gets to choose whether or not they will end up committing suicide, and that choice belongs to them, not me.\n\n&gt; So you're saying that you don't believe that there are two different kinds of suicides?\n\nI don't believe that there are two types of suicides. There are only two types of suicides. One is where the person commits suicide by themselves, which is called \"self-suicide\", and the other is where the person kills someone else, which is called \"assault\".\n\n&gt; So if you believe that suicide is not a right, why are you holding onto the idea that suicide isn't a right?\n\nBecause", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_31kfkt", "utterance_id": "t1_cq2iwml", "response_tokens": 199, "context_tokens": 467}}

Zero is just another concept and not a quantity itself. In your example, I could have written down a million zeros but still have only one million dollars. The number of zeros doesn't equal the amount of money. \n\nThat's what zero does for me. It's just another symbol that we use to help us communicate things without having to say the exact quantity out loud. As long as we're communicating effectively, zero is fine. \n\n&gt; And yet I don't understand why zero is considered to be a real number. \n\nBecause it is a symbol. Symbolic representations are different from physical objects and are therefore considered to be \"real\". This means that we can talk about symbols even though we know their physical form.\n\nThe reason zero is considered a \"symbol\" is that it represents a number that cannot exist physically. It's a number that exists within our minds and allows us to communicate. We call that number zero. Because it's a symbolic representation, it also doesn't actually exist physically, which is why zero is often called a \"number.\" It's just a symbol. Symbols allow us to express ideas and thoughts", "response_2": "&gt;So what is your definition of infinity? \n\nYou defined it as something that is not quantifiable. So there is no meaning to it. The only reason we define it as a number is so that we don't have to use the word infinity.\n\nBut I think you're absolutely correct. Infinity is just another name for something that isn't measurable. So whatever we call it, it doesn't have any real meaning unless we choose to give it one. So I guess I'll just stop calling it \"infinite\". \n\nEdit: I agree with this. There really is no difference between \"infinity\" and \"indefinite\" in mathematics. It was just a matter of convenience for me to call it \"infinite\". Let's all go back to calling it \"infinite\" and \"indefinite\" once more. \nThanks again!

Her response suggests that there's nothing atypical about being genderqueer when there obviously is.  There's nothing wrong with being genderqueer, just like there's nothing wrong with having red hair or being an astronaut, but it is atypical; someone may be surprised to learn this about another person.\n\nTo me, this just seems like a reason to put typical people on the defensive when they broach the topic of gender studies.\n\nChange my view.\n\nEdit #1:\nAt this point, I'm just deciding who to give a delta to.

It's true that we often use \"typical\" to talk about how some group of people behave, but that doesn't make those people themselves. They are just a subset of the general population - they are not unique. In fact, it's possible for a person to be both a member of a subgroup and a member of another subgroup (e.g., a man and a woman), which means that no two members of the same subgroup can be considered \"the same.\" \n\nBut even if we were willing to accept that the terms are misleading, it's still unclear why they exist. Why bother giving such vague labels? After all, our brains aren't wired to categorize every single thing into a specific set of categories.

And if it's typical to you, then you'd say it's typical, even if it's not typical for your friends.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks - that's their prerogative.\n\n&gt;The difference between typical and atypical is that people are expected to fit into certain categories.  For example, we might expect men to be strong and women to be feminine, which are often categorized by society as typical.  \n&gt;But what does it mean to be atypical?  \n\nWell, that's a good question.

As such, I tend to favor \"conservative\" candidates (in Northern California, the \"right\" is still pretty damn far left), but our region and state is strongly blue.

One is the one that is given orally, where it takes several days for your immune system to develop antibodies. This type is called an intramuscular injection, and is used for children. The other is the one that is given subcutaneously, where it is injected under the skin. This type is called an intradermal injection, and is used for adults. The difference between the two is how long the injection lasts and how many doses you need to take.\n\nSo, let me explain why I think the first part is misleading:\n\nYou say that you are scared because you \"don't get the flu often\", but that's not necessarily true. It's not like you never get sick, and you have to wait for months for the flu shot. Your body can react to the virus quickly enough, so the first time you get the flu, you'll feel pretty good.

It's much easier than saying \"This thing isn't worth it because you won't ever get sick.\"  \n\nThe problem with the flu vaccine being useless is that it doesn't help prevent actual infections.  The vaccines work by making you immune to the illness.  Once you get the flu, you'll still get it.  What it does do is teach your body how to fight it off better, which makes it less likely to cause complications.  \n\nThere are a few reasons why this works:\n\n1. Your body already has antibodies ready.  This means that once you get the flu, you'll already have built up some protection against it.  \n2.

My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average - the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nI suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. As the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment. This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place.\n\nStill, despite this - I can't help but get pissed when liberals rag on the native working class as \"Rednecks\" or \"Bogans\" (Or for black people trying to get ahead, \"Uncle Toms\") that supposedly vote against their own best interest by voting to halt immigration.

What I was saying is that there's a psychological effect that causes people to judge others based on their race rather than ethnicity. I think that if the country had more minorities, this psychological effect would probably become less pronounced.

While three or four dollars is not much money on its own, the entertainment value of the product, in my experience, not worth the amount I pay. I'll use an example.\n\nRecently, I bought the first issue of the new Ms. Marvel series at $2.99. In it, there were 20 pages of story and it took me about 10-15 minutes maybe to read through the whole book. There were about four scenes in the book (the store, the house, the party, and Kamala gaining her powers), all of which served to introduce Kamala, but little else. While the narrative was entertaining, it stopped the moment it began to develop, leaving a hook for the reader to dish out an additional three dollars to further the story.\n\nConversely, a film ticket may cost about three times as much  (about seven-ten dollars depending on where and when you buy the ticket), but for that price you're getting at least an hour and a half of entertainment with a full three act story. [A book can cost between five to twenty dollars, but for that price you're getting at least several hours worth of entertainment.](http://www.slj.com/2013/06/research/sljs-average-book-prices-2013/#_). I've read other comics and I can usually finish an issue in about 10 minutes. To me, paying three or four dollars for about ten minutes of entertainment is not worth it.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It's because movies have so many plot twists and character arcs that we often forget how much fun those things are. \n\nIn terms of comic books, I suppose if you want to do something fun and exciting, then go for it. But it seems to be a bit of a hassle. The only thing I can think of is going for it, getting a few hours of entertainment, and then buying a second hand copy for $8. That would take about a week to complete, and it wouldn't make sense to spend $8 to get a cheap copy of a comic book you already own. And I haven't even seen this happen yet. \n\nBut perhaps this isn't too bad for me? I mean, I could always wait until I had time to read them, and then buy another set to keep around. Maybe I'll just read a few pages of the next issue and throw it away. Then again, I know nothing about these stories yet, so maybe I'll pick up a few more pages later.

So I figured it wouldn't be worth it. It turns out that's wrong.\n\nNow, if you say I shouldn't expect college kids to care about anything beyond their degree, then I agree. But I also understand that many college kids are smart enough to realize that even if they do end up having to go to a big university, it will still be fun and interesting, and that they probably won't need to read this crap. So I guess I don't think college kids are dumb, and therefore we shouldn't expect them to care about the crap we make.\n\nHowever, the point here is that I believe the same thing applies to adults who want to read comics. They probably won't care too much about the comics themselves, but they will care about the people who write and draw the comics. So if you ask an adult who wants to read comics why they care about them, they'll tell you \"Well, I enjoy", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2d8j1c", "utterance_id": "t1_cjn538q", "response_tokens": 124, "context_tokens": 479}}

I have never used this, because the start menu itsself is in the bottom of my screen, so if I wanted to choose something from that menu, I would have to move my mouse to the bottom left anyway. Might as well press the start button on my screen while doing so.\n\nOne of the reasons I hate the windows key so much is that it also opens the start menu when you're in full screen. When playing games, the Alt key is used often enough to sometimes miss it and press windows instead. This causes my game to exit full screen, and often my character to die.\n\n\nYesterday, I found out that my leopard doesn't have one, but two windows keys. Why? Just why? Does my right hand also need immediate acces to an unimportant function?\n\n\nPlease, CMV!\n\nEdit: You've done it, you've changed my view. It's not completely useless thanks to shortcuts. I might use these!\n\nComment 1: * Win + D : Goto desktop\n* Win + E : Open Explorer\n* Win + R : Open Run dialog\n* Win + P : Toggle video output (switch between screen and projector, for example)\n* Win + L : Lock computer\n* Win + Pause/Break : Open System Properties\n* Win + arrow keys : manipulate window (minimize, maximize, align)\n\nI use all of these every day. You don't *need* the Windows key to use your computer, but these shortcuts are very convenient and a lot faster than the several mouse clicks needed for each of those operations. \n\nI have yet to find a use for the Menu key, though.\n\nAlso, I believe you can disable the Windows key for full-screen applications so it doesn't interfere with your gaming.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I do not want to be able to open the file explorer in full screen mode\n\nYou may be correct, but I'm still interested in your opinion about the necessity of the Windows key. Is it really necessary for every task or even any tasks?\n\nIf you have an external monitor connected to your computer, the \"right\" way to access the Start Menu is by pressing the Alt + Tab shortcut key. That allows you to switch between multiple windows. If you want to open the Start Menu directly, you'll have to press both the Alt and the Windows keys simultaneously. \n\nIt is possible to configure your keyboard so that you can use the Windows key without switching to the Start Menu at all times. You just have to type the letter W into your keyboard before you hit the Windows key.\n\nAs far as being able to switch between different programs, you could simply press the Windows key twice. You will get the same result. \n\nThe reason I say this is because if you use the Windows key to open programs like Paint or Notepad, you won't be able to quickly switch back to another program when you close the previous one. For instance, if you were working on an important document, you'd probably want to save it first, then close the application, then", "response_2": "&gt; But what about the \"menu\" key?\n\nYou do it more frequently now than before, but even then there are still times where you want to open the start menu or go directly into settings without having to switch menus.\n\n&gt; Do you really mean \"open the start menu when you're in full screen\"? If so, does that mean that it will always be open?\n\nIt could, but most people just use it once per game session, so it's rarely necessary.\n\n&gt; How does it differ from the 'Menu' key?\n\nThe 'Menu' key allows you to change the system settings, such as the language and keyboard layout. The Windows key allows you to access the Start Menu and other application menus.\n\n&gt; And how does it differ from the 'Pause/Break' key?\n\nThere is no difference. Both allow you to switch between different programs.\n\n&gt; So, how does it work?\n\nWhen you double-click any icon in the Start Menu, it shows up in the search bar at the top-right corner of the screen. To open the Start Menu:\n\n  * Hold down the Ctrl key and click the icon you want to open.\n  * Alternatively, hold down the Shift key and click the icon you want to open.\n\nIf you want to", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1wvouv", "utterance_id": "t1_cf68msm", "response_tokens": 64, "context_tokens": 425}}

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: So in economics, signaling is an activity you undertake to send a signal to others about yourself, not for its own benefit. \n\nFor example, part of why people buy expensive clothes/cars is to signal to others that they have money, not because those things are inherently more useful.\n\nBryan Caplan of George Mason University [describes it as follows](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/11/the_magic_of_ed.html):\n\n&gt;According to the signaling model, employers reward educational success because of what it shows (\"signals\") about the student.  Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.  When a student excels in school, then, employers correctly infer that he's likely to be a good worker.  What precisely did he study?  What did he learn how to do?  Mere details.  As long as you were a good student, employers surmise that you'll quickly learn what you need to know on the job.\n\n\nObviously this applies to some fields more than others.  Med school is not just signaling.  But for most degrees, especially outside of hard science, I think the signaling model is persuasive.\n\n**EDIT 1**\n\nEdit to clarify based on a question below.  The view is not that signaling is a majority factor in all degrees, but that for the majority of college students, the majority of the value of the degree is the signal it sends, not specific things they learn in class.\n\nWould also be really interested in responses to [this stat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) that only 27% of college graduates have jobs related to their major.\n\nThanks for all the replies so far by the way, has been very interesting and civil.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, if you're going to argue against hiring someone solely based on their education, then I'm afraid you're going to lose out on a lot of people who will go to law school or business school because they don't have enough relevant experience or knowledge to make a good lawyer or CEO. \n\nIf we're talking about something like a PhD, then yes, it could happen. But it would probably be much more difficult for a PhD candidate to get into a position where they can demonstrate themselves as having learned enough to actually make a difference. \n\nIn short, I think there are a lot of different ways to show people that you have qualities that you want them to see. If we're talking about a career change, then it might be worth considering whether they're willing to give up their current job in order to pursue one that better matches their interests and skills. But again, I think there are many different factors that go into making decisions that ultimately determine whether someone gets hired at all.\n\nYou're correct in saying that there are many aspects of a degree that are tied directly to the field of study.

You're not doing anything productive with your time.  So it doesn't make sense to you to try harder and see if you can improve.  \n\nYou might want to look at the work of John Hattie.  His thesis is that the amount of effort put into learning correlates with the outcome (or at least, a measure thereof) of learning.  He does this by looking at hundreds of studies across many different subjects.  Some of these studies show that the amount of effort one puts into studying correlates with the outcome of learning.

I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  \n\n&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  \n4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  \n5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  \n10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, \"driver\" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  \n15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   \n  \nBy the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.

This leads to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem because the child feels like he/she isn't good enough.  Because of this, the child doesn't want to tell anyone about the bullying or try to change their behavior.  And if they do try to change their behavior, it feels like they're failing or failing miserably.  So instead of changing their behavior, they just continue to suffer from the negative effects of the bullying.

I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I don't think there's a perfect solution.

So yeah, if we were to implement something like that, then yes, it would kill many people. But it would also eliminate many people from society because it would create an entire new group that would struggle to survive. \n\nSo you are saying that if we had a law that said that if someone smoked, and they died, then they'd have to pay for a life sentence? Is this right?\n\n&gt; But that's not exactly the case. There are certain individuals out there, specifically those who are very wealthy and are capable of paying for it, and they can even choose whether or not they want to pay, depending on their financial situation. \n\nI agree with you, but what if the government decided that if you wanted to pay, then you should pay? Would everyone still be killed? Or would it be different? And what if someone couldn't afford to pay? Would they still be executed?\n\n&gt; So you have a group of people who are extremely rich and who are willing to pay for life sentences? \n\nThis is where", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not saying that the government shouldn't enforce those laws.

So maybe they could try to implement stricter ones like the one i suggested earlier? Or might someone be able to come up with something else?\n\n&gt; But how can I prove that it is possible to prevent the execution of anyone in such a way? I mean, I know the US Constitution says \"No man shall be punished twice for the same offense\" but does that really prevent it? It seems to me that because of the existence of such punishments, it's going to happen again and again until it gets out of hand and everyone ends up being executed. \n\nThe only reason I would argue against that is because I believe it's impossible to prevent executions.

Anyway, spoilers ahead.\n\nIt has been a while since reading 1984, but I saw someone post a thread where everyone was talking about how the book had a really depressing ending, but when I finished reading it I felt kind of happy.\n\nThroughout the whole book we feel sorry for Winston's circumstances, that he has to live under complete domination by The Party and he understands that they are changing history and suppressing his individuality. He seems constantly depressed, when he first sees Julia he is paranoid she is part of the thought police and he says he hates her, when really he has no reason to.\n\nIn the end he learns to love Big Brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss. After the struggle of the whole book it is nice that the protagonist we have grown attached to has eventually found peace and is no longer scared.\n\nI understand why some people find it depressing, as The Party aren't overthrown and the totalitarians that oppress the people win. But it was foolish to think that Winston could have really changed the situation, and in his circumstance it is surely better to follow The Party and be happy than struggle towards an unreachable goal and be depressed.\n\nIgnorance is strength CMV.\n\nEdit: I'm surprised and happy with the amount of discussion this has brought about.

There is a reason why Winston chose to go on the run after all these years, and it is not simply that he wanted to escape.

But it seems to me that if someone consistently puts their hands in their mouths while handling these foods, then there is a significant likelihood that their hands will come into contact with both peanut butter and jelly. \n\nThat's true. I think it is also true that the people who often use a kitchen knife are more likely to accidentally touch something else besides themselves.\n\n&gt; I can't believe it. That sounds reasonable, so much of the reason why I'm still not sure about this is that I feel like it's a bit of a stretch to assume that all the people who have never been allergic to peanuts are as likely to accidentally eat peanut butter and jelly as those who have allergies.\n\nThis is not true. In fact, the probability of accidental eating of peanut butter and jelly is extremely low. It is actually higher than the probability of getting a cold during the winter months (which is lower than the probability of being allergic to peanuts). \n\nIt is also important to note that most peanut butter and jelly sandwiches contain no peanuts at all.

For example, you could mix peanut butter with some other vegetable (like carrots), but you wouldn't want to use that same vegetable in another recipe.  It might still be technically safe to eat, but it would be harder to do consistently across recipes.\n\nSo yes, you can mix peanut butter and jelly together, but that doesn't make it safe to eat.  \n\nAlso, I think it's important to point out that this isn't something I'm saying that you have to avoid mixing peanut butter and jelly together at all times.  Just that if you don't mind mixing them together occasionally, that's fine.

Fuck everyone who thinks they're making a point with it. There is no logic in it - it's used to demean the subject, insult intelligence, and attempt to guilt the 'offending' party. It's myopic, callous, and condescending.\n\nNo one should feel guilty for being themselves. Ever. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being part of the majority, well that's life. I shouldn't have to explain that the majority of people are in a majority, that seems redundant - but these 'arguments' are always phrased as if that isn't the case. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being a minority, that's also life. \n\nThe arguments assume that the subject is incapable of empathy, and is actively attempting to hold to these 'privileges' and keep them away from everyone else. That's simply not the case. Yes, white men can walk safely down the streets in the suburbs, black men don't need to lock their doors when they roll through the ghetto, women aren't seen as creepy when they ask someone out - *good*, why is this a bad thing? In an ideal world, everyone would feel safe walking or driving in any part of town at any time, and no one would be treated as a creeper for expressing interest in another, and so forth. This isn't an ideal world - that may suck when situations where we don't have such 'privilege' are encountered, but that's life. \n\nWorse, these arguments require, by necessity, the outlook of a societal parasite. Rather than working to change things or make their own situation better, these people want to shame others for what they themselves don't have. As if screeching shrilly at someone that they should feel bad for being who they are, is somehow a morally superior stance.\n\n**edit:** View changed.

The issue is that the definition of privilege has been constructed over time to include only some types of privileges. Privilege does not have to mean something negative, it could just be a neutral term. To use \"privilege\" to mean good for everyone is like using \"lack of understanding\" to mean lack of knowledge. A word can have many definitions and meanings, depending on how it is used.\n\nI think it's important to note that most of the comments that followed the post were about privilege and how it impacts individuals, not society. People often refer to society as having \"privileges\", which is true because all members of society have access to certain rights and benefits, but that doesn't make the society itself privileged. Privilege is an abstract concept that applies only to specific groups of people within a society. It doesn't apply to all members of a society, nor do its members.\n\nI am not a political theorist, but my impression is that privilege is used more in a moralistic sense to justify actions that are considered unjustified.

When people get into trouble they are usually justified for taking the actions that they take. \n\nThe reason why Gandhi is still considered as one of the greatest leaders in history is that when people got into trouble, instead of justifying themselves for doing things they didn't like, they said \"this is what you should have done\", \"let me help you out\". That is the essence of Gandhi's leadership.\n\nThe main thing is that Gandhi used the actions he took in protest against the British to fight for freedom. If we look at his books, he clearly stated that it is not necessary to fight against the British in order to gain independence, that it is possible to win the war through peaceful means. This is also reflected in his famous quote \"We are not fighting for independence but freedom\". \n\nSo there is a big difference between Gandhi's leadership and his politics.

I think, in the long run, that motivates me more to help in more substantial ways, such as volunteering, which I do frequently. So even though I may be doing more societal harm than good in the short term, I think it pays off in the long term. Why should I not behave this way?\n\nEdit: Nice work; I'm mostly changed. I will start donating to a charity instead and use panhandlers to remind myself to donate if I get out of the habit. Now I just have to get better at saying \"no,\" ha.\n\nComment 1: To look at it from the perspective of harm done, rather than benefit received: you could do much less harm by giving to a homelessness charity (who actively work to make sure your money doesn't fund a drug habit) or giving homeless people food or warm clothing than just giving them money to do anything they want with.\n\nBut you're still giving and still trying to help, so you'd retain the \"benefits\" to yourself.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think, in the long run, that motivates me more to help in more substantial ways, such as volunteering, which I do frequently.\n\nThe argument about helping is the same for both. You can only help as much as you can afford, so why spend your time and resources on helping someone who is already struggling? \n\nThat said, I would say the best answer to this question is simply, \"if you really care about making others happy.\"\n\nIf you know what's going on around you, and if you are willing to help those in need, then you're actually helping *yourself*. If you're not aware of the situation, and if you aren't willing to assist those in need, then you're actually harming yourself. \n\nI think most people will go through life without ever realizing that their actions were hurting themselves, but once\nyou realize it, you'll regret it forever, and you'll have no regrets for the rest of your life. \n\nSo if you know the situation around you and you care enough about making others happy, then you're actually helping yourself.

You get something for nothing and you get benefits from doing so. The reason I'm against charities is because I find their methods of making decisions about what they want to do with my donations to be questionable. If you want to help someone who needs help, you need to make sure they know exactly where the help is going before you give it to them. That's the whole point of charities. They exist so that those who volunteer can do things that would otherwise go unnoticed by us. \n\nI'm not saying that every single time I give to a charity, I'll spend two hours working on improving their situation and then spending two minutes helping them. But I'm saying that there are certain types of people whose lives need more attention and help than others' and I believe that we should give that attention and help to these people whenever possible. It's not like I have a special interest in seeing a homeless person get better - I just see people who need help, and I'm willing to help when I can.\n\nSo yes, I am guilty of some form of dependency or addiction.

Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future. \n \nFurther information:\n\nExamples of diseases or ailments.\n•Congenital Anomalies\n•Malignan\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I don't think you're making any valid points here, though I appreciate your effort\n\nI am trying to make some valid points.

But if you're willing to accept the possibility that we never get to see the outcome of our actions, then why should we waste money on someone else?\n\nSecondly, maybe the child will become productive later in life. And perhaps it will help him/her in some way. Maybe it will make them healthier (which means less medical bills) or make them more successful (which means less criminal activity). Or even that the child will become a great inventor because of all the knowledge he/she gained while growing up. \n\nSo yes, I agree that the child is valuable and important.

Sooner or later we will have to find another way to live. That is why my position on this is wrong. If we didn't want to eat meat (which I really like), we wouldn't make it into our diet.

Therefore it should be seen as a bad thing, and childlike wonder and enthusiasm should be promoted at all stages of life.\n\nComment 1: You're confusing the act with the judgement. Whether or not something is 'dignified' is a value judgement about some act a person is committing, specifically, whether or not that person is worthy of respect for committing that act. What you're really saying here is not that 'dignity' is toxic, but what we consider 'dignified' is toxic, which is to say sometimes our social norms are toxic (which is true).\n\nHowever, dignity can still be a useful concept. If someone does something worthy of respect we can encourage that behavior by calling it dignified. On the other hand, if someone does something bad but not technically *morally wrong*, we might be able to discourage that behavior by calling it undignified. Using the concept of dignity properly is all about properly identifying what should and should not be considered acts worthy of respect. I think you're right about how the concept of dignity is misused, but it's only misused when acts or persons are improperly thought of to be worthy of respect.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think you're right about how the concept of dignity is misused, but it's only misused when acts or persons are improperly thought of to be worthy of respect.\n\nYou're absolutely right, I have no idea where you get your information from.\n\n&gt;however, dignity can still be a useful concept\n\nIt isn't necessary, just as morality isn't necessary. It's a good thing, but it shouldn't be the sole reason why people behave morally. \n\nDignity can also be applied to things like relationships, work, family, etc., rather than being an end in itself. The concept could be more broadly defined to include everything from the most basic needs such as food and shelter, to more complex ones such as marriage, parenting, children, education, and so on. In this case, however, I would argue that it's not necessary to apply it to these areas, as they are all essentially moral issues that need to be resolved. \n\nThis is my view of the issue, and I'm happy to change it if you disagree with me.

It has no basis in objective reality, so it doesn't matter if the person being praised has any moral worth whatsoever - they just have more self-esteem than everyone else, and therefore deserve praise. \n\n&gt; And there's also the problem of 'unjust' dignity.\n\nIt isn't clear to me what you mean by \"unjust\" dignity. Perhaps you're asking how we can make people feel proud of themselves without insulting them? Maybe you're wondering if it's possible to create a sense of dignity within a context where we expect people to be treated unjustly?\n\n&gt; I'm not suggesting that it's an unearned quality, just that we shouldn't try to claim it. \n\nThat's a great point, thanks!

Others that sing what someone else wrote should not be considered artists because their material is not created by them. (In the same vein, I wouldn't consider cover bands to be artists either.  But they are musicians, since they are playing instruments instead of building beats on a computer. But back to singers...). Their music is created by someone else *for* them, which they then record and take most of the credit for.  \n\nThus, singers are just *performing* a song, even if they don't ever do any live shows. They are performing the song in the studio when they record it. I get that some singers are truly talented, but I find it difficult to call them artists if someone else had the inspiration to write the material that they are simply converting to a format (music) that many people enjoy listening to. \n\nI've always been a little absentminded about radio music, since I mostly listen to progressive rock and metal, but when I discovered that many songs you hear on the radio aren't even written by the people that are performing them, I was astounded.\n\nComment 1: Part of the artistry of music **is** performance. Would you also call a singer that has no stage presence, no dance moves, and is generally visually unattractive an artist and a musician, even if they clearly could not perform given those premises? I think even performing a cover and doing so with great vocal ability and amazingly captivating performance captures the spirit of artistry and musicianship... especially considering how many bands have 1 member who writes while the rest only *perform*.\n\nComment 2: But the other band members will write their own parts to accompany what the main writer is writing, correct?

That's why I was arguing that a deer killing itself is much less likely than a deer killing someone who uses a firearm to kill them. \n\nI'm sorry for my poor wording. The point I wanted to get across is that we shouldn't assume that there is no risk involved in shooting an animal. If you want to shoot a bear, you will always have some level of risk (there might be better methods), but if you use a bow, you'll never have this risk. So while it may not be fair to hunt with a bow, it is still a fair decision. \n\nI understand how hard it is to accept something that goes against the norm, but I do think it's worth pointing out that hunting is a serious business, and many hunters have a good reason for choosing this method of hunting over another. I appreciate everyone coming up with their own reasons for preferring to hunt with a bow, but I feel as though people who choose to hunt with a bow have made a mistake by assuming that they're on equal footing with the rest of the world.

I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole, the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.\n\nAdmittedly, I have had a pro-Imperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind (especially so) and Oblivion, the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be, and so I've always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.\n\nBut now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I'm even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.\n\n**1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**\n\nThis should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.) In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.\n\nOf course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don't forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I'm sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire.

Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a “spreading of the gospel”, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. \n\nThis is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either “They get a free pass” or “They never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.” \n\nThis leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view “the truth”, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?\n\nTL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about.

(I swear if I hear \"Straw Man\" one more time, I'll rip my hair out.) I don't know if it's just college kids flexing their new found argument skills, the rise of Aspies and the socially awkward, or just an increase in people trying to be Sheldon Cooper, but whatever it is, it merely comes across as condescending, arrogant, and dismissive.\n\nFirst off, Logic itself, while in theory is a perfect concept of linear thought, in practice, it is performed in the minds of human beings. Since human beings are inherently flawed and imperfect beings, the \"pureness\" of the Logic will be flawed and imperfect accordingly. Warped by the persons prejudices. Skewed by their assumptions. Bent to fit their personal preferences. No human being can actually properly *use* pure logic.

Anger. Violence. Hate. War. Maybe it does, but it is absolutely worth it in the grand scheme when you realize what good things passion brings to humanity. Art, Music, Philosophy, Discussion, and Literature can all be broken down into mathematics and base components but it was the creator's passion that willed the note from the violin, or streaked brush across canvas. Science and Logic may have been used to chart the stars and manufacture the ships, but it was a sea captain's passion that had him sail off the edge of that map, past \"There Be Dragons Here\", and into parts unknown.

For example, we can say that there's something called \"justice\" or \"fairness,\" which can be seen as absolute truth, but it isn't. Justice is relative to circumstances, and there are different ways of viewing justice that could be considered equally valid.

Every transaction that you did today, that you didn't even notice, what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service.

In this case, society prescribes meaning to a birth precisely every 365 days post-birth. Why? Intrinsically, there is no value in this date. A day is an approximation of the length of time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis with respect to the sun. Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the 24 hour period in which we were born when it occurs 365 days later? A year later, the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day, yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning.\n\n**Sidenote:** I've gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That is exactly what happened when the states were established, so there would be some sort of armed militia. This is a major flaw in the argument. \n\nI am also aware that a lot of countries have armed militias today, but these are not based on the Second Amendment at all. They use different kinds of weapons. In the US, the military has access to a large number of weapons, including machine guns, sniper rifles, grenade launchers, etc. However, there is a limit to how many guns a country can afford, and many countries have had trouble getting enough guns to actually make their armies strong enough to deal with threats. \n\nIn addition, most countries are either already militarily powerful, or are very close to being so. Many have been able to achieve this status because of successful wars fought elsewhere, rather than having to build up their own arsenals.

The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on.

In a few instances, such as the case of the South Dakota vs. Nebraska referendum in 2010, the difference was very small and didn't impact any important decisions. There were no supermajorities in either chamber to block legislation passed by the other.

If they were allowed to ask questions or offer suggestions, it would make it much easier, and they wouldn't feel like they're doing it all by themselves.

Most teachers are employed as part-time workers, which means that they have to take breaks from class every once in awhile. This can cause stress and burnout for teachers, especially if they are dealing with a lot of young children at the same time. If you want a teacher to be happy, you need to pay them enough to give them time off, even if that means going on sick days.

It would be possible to use this information to judge whether or not the teacher did an excellent job of explaining the material.

Students from middle school to college take a vow of silence in an effort to encourage schools and classmates to address the problem of anti-LGBT behavior by illustrating the silencing effect of bullying and harassment on LGBT students and those perceived to be LGBT.\" The most recent Day of Silence was on the 17th.\n\nI participated in this event multiple times when I was in high school. People generally knew that it was meant to show support for LGBT rights, but not much beyond that. People primarily seemed to use it as a way to avoid having to answer questions in class for one day.\n\nBesides my anecdotal experience, the movement fails logically as well. People's bigoted opinions are not going to be swayed by silence. In order to change people's attitudes towards LGBT* people, everyone needs to speak out about the issue of bullying and harassment, not stay silent about it.\n\nSilence does not speak volumes in this context. People cannot be educated if you are not explaining anything to them. People who bully LGBT* kids aren't going to try to understand why everyone is being silent, and even if they do understand, they aren't going to care.\n\nComment 1: The silence itself does nothing, you're right, but peer pressure is a powerful force, especially at that age, and this is a case where it can be harnessed for some positive impact.\n\nGrowing up where I did, disapproval of homosexuality was \"normal\".  It was just expected that you thought gay people were bad, and no one reacted negatively at all if you went around saying it to anyone who would listen.  \n\nSeeing that that's not the case, that a lot of people DO support gay rights, is a powerful piece of information.  I was never religious, so I didn't get on board with the whole hating gay people thing, but that was a big shock when I got to college, realizing that it was okay to outwardly support gay rights, because *other* people supported it.\n\nSo that's what the day of silence can accomplish.  Whether it's more or less effective than any other method, I don't know, but the point is showing people that supporting gay rights IS the norm, and not the exception.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not sure how much time has passed since I started talking about it, but I have to say that I think that the day of silence is still relevant today.\n\nWell, there are lots of things happening now.

When I first heard about the Day of Silence, I thought it was something that only happened once every 5 years or so. Now, I hear that it happens almost daily, and that it's been a great way to raise awareness about LGBT issues, which means that I'll probably continue to teach my friends about LGBT issues, and maybe learn more myself along the way.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: \"Drugs are bad, so they should be illegal\" just doesn't cut it. That's not thinking things through. You have to examine all the various consequences, effects, and repercussions. For a law to be just, it must prevent more harm than it causes; anything but legalization of all drugs (not just decriminalization) fails that test.\n\nPossibly the most popular argument for drug prohibition is due to the social harm caused by drug addiction. Certainly drug addiction does cause social harm, but that harm pales in comparison to what is caused by imprisoning vast swaths of society. Separating families and saddling users and sellers with a permanent black mark that destroys most opportunity for gainful employment and being a productive, contributing member of society is vastly destructive. In short, \"drugs will ruin your life, so we'll punish you for using drugs by ruining your life\" just fails at logic.\n\nThen there's the argument that buying drugs funds criminals and terrorists. Well, no shit, genius. If you don't allow legitimate businesses to sell it, it's going to be the criminals. This gives rise to the black market, which is the source of the vast majority of \"drug related\" crime (only a small portion is comprised of actual intoxication-induced misbehavior). Legalization of the drug trade takes the money out of the hands of gangs and terrorists, and eliminates the black market and its associated crime; this is why mere decriminalization for users is not adequate.\n\nLet's also look at effectiveness. Essentially, there isn't any. Prohibition does not decrease usage rates, which is the primary goal. I've heard the argument that \"at least it increases street prices,\" but this is a terrible argument. Increased prices don't deter use, they just make addiction more financially devastating for addicts (thus increasing, not decreasing harm), and the increased profits just add incentive for criminals to produce/traffic/sell more - and use violence to protect their profits. In short, when you consider the total lack of effectiveness alongside all of the collateral social damage, drug prohibition doesn't actually *do* anything except harm society.\n\nAll in all, any opinion supportin\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I'm not saying that if people couldn't buy drugs, they wouldn't use them.

But if you think that if people didn't need to use drugs, they wouldn't use them, you're missing the point entirely. \n\nThe problem is that people can't afford to buy drugs without some form of government intervention or regulation. So even if we were able to get rid of the black markets, they'd still exist because of the lack of access to legal drugs. They're simply a way for those who do have access to them to hide from the laws. \n\nIf you're saying that people shouldn't be able to buy drugs, but aren't forced to use them anyway, then you're implicitly agreeing with me. You believe that if we allowed people to freely choose whether or not they want to use drugs, they would use them anyway. But that's just not how it works. We only let people use drugs because they can't otherwise afford to, and since they won't use them anyway, they can't use them legally either. \n\nSo if you're saying that if people couldn't buy drugs, they wouldn't use them, then you're arguing", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not saying drug prohibition is bad as a policy.

The fact that it is only legal for people who are already addicted to something.  People who aren't addicted may want to use it anyway, but won't because they can't afford it or because they feel guilty about it.  So if someone has a problem, they can buy and take drugs, even if they're not legally allowed to do so.  They're still getting pleasure from it.  \n\n2. The fact that it's only legal for those who are already addicted.

If you have any other reason for going back to work, other than some version of \"we can't afford for me stay home,\" great! Have a great career! You are not to whom this post is addressed.\n* I know that I am being terribly gender exclusive with my language. I fully support dads that want to stay home. In reality, though, I have never met one. Every person I have heard give the \"can't afford to stay home\" line was a woman. In reality, though, my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that \"we just can't afford for him to stay home.\"\n* I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me, I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. **BUT THIS IS TOTALLY MY OPINION AND IS IRRELEVANT TO MY ARGUMENT.** I don't really care if you think moms and/or dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.\n\nHere is the core of my argument. **Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities, over which they have no real control, will not allow them to do so. **Essentially, they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not saying that every single man has to choose between staying at home and going to work. But it seems to me that many men have made choices where they've chosen to leave their families behind. \n\nThat's an interesting point.  What I mean by \"leave their families behind\" is simply the idea that they're working somewhere else.  They may not have to leave their homes for a while, but they'll need to travel.  \n\nFor instance, if they're working at the grocery store, they may have to drive around for a while before arriving home.  If they're working at a factory, they may have to commute more often.  The point is that they're forced to work from different places, but there's no way that they can't stay home during those times when they need to be at home. \n\nIn other words, they are making choices based on their own personal circumstances.  It's not something you can force anyone to do.  And the fact that they aren't able to make these choices means that they're forcing themselves to stay home.  That's what makes it even more true that they have a right to stay home and take care of the kids.  \n\nIf your mom says she wants to stay home", "response_2": "&gt; But what if your spouse has a job that makes money enough for her to live comfortably and still pay off all the debt? \n\nThat's exactly where the problem lies. The people in these situations are usually not working full-time, but they're not even paying off their mortgage yet - let alone their child's education. \n\nFor example, imagine an elderly woman who wants to stay home to take care of her grandchildren when they grow up. Her husband is doing 40 hours a week at his job, but he barely gets by living on the minimum wage, and there's little room for saving. So he can't even afford to pay off his mortgage. She has no choice but to stay home and look after the kids, which costs $150 per month and keeps her out of retirement savings (which she probably shouldn't be). That means her monthly expenses will increase, putting more strain on her finances. It also puts pressure on her to make sure everyone else in the house pays the bills too. And eventually, she'll find herself having to spend less money on her own needs - maybe even having to cut back entirely - before she can afford to start looking for a new job. This is how many single mothers end up unable to afford to stay", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2i6l9n", "utterance_id": "t1_ckzcg4f", "response_tokens": 403, "context_tokens": 451}}

However, if someone really is the opposite gender, then it would by definition not be homosexual.\n\nThe second prong of attack is the rule against cross dressing. However, if someone really is the opposite gender, it's not cross dressing.\n\nThe third prong of attack is against physical mutilation of the body.

It is always something else that commonly goes along with transgender issues that makes it wrong.\n\nEdit: This argument depends upon a non-biological definition of gender.

Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement.\n\nThe manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points:\n\n1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking).\n\n2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components.\n\n3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. \n\nWhen we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there.\n\nIt is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency  over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. It is my contention that hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there.\n\nI think that's a bit simplistic.  The problem with this is that you're talking about a situation where the electric motor isn't being utilized as much as it could.  It doesn't matter how much battery life they use, if they aren't going to be able to use it fully, they'll be wasting it.\n\nI'm not saying that they shouldn't try to increase their fuel mileage, but they shouldn't waste that potential fuel.  The reason why a car runs so efficiently is because it's constantly moving, accelerating, braking, turning, etc, and that's exactly why it needs that much power.  If they weren't capable of running as fast as they do now, they'd probably never have reached their maximum efficiency.\n\n&gt;If you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. \n\nThat's true, but then again, wouldn't they still need some sort of power source?", "response_2": "&gt; When we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth.\n\nThat's one of the main reasons why many people do not buy hybrids, especially those who are concerned about the cost of gas. The reason they don't is that even though they're cheaper, they still use the same amount of gas per mile, so they end up paying more for every gallon of gas they use.\n\nAs I said before, I think that the \"myth\" of fuel efficiency comes from the idea that there's some sort of magic formula that makes the fuel economy of a car equal to its miles-per-gallon. However, when I look at the numbers, it doesn't work like that. What it does is show that the fuel economy of a car is actually lower than it looks because of the additional load of the battery and electric motors, but also because the cars themselves aren't being driven any differently. If you drive a car and have a regular gas-powered car behind it, then you can see that the electric version is definitely faster, but that the electric model is still going to burn more gas than the gas-powered model. \n\nIn the case of a Prius, the difference between the two models is pretty small,", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1khlm7", "utterance_id": "t1_cbp0hy4", "response_tokens": 650, "context_tokens": 397}}

We can observe the effects of gravity on earth, and the effects of gravity in our solar system near Mercury. If we say that the laws should be the same everywhere, then we notice what we observe on earth is not true for Mercury.

Therefore, if there are no uniformities, then all individuals are unique and therefore can never compare to one another. \n\nI suppose you could argue that since every individual has an identical DNA, then they will always be \"equal\" based on genetics, but I find this somewhat illogical because I know that when I grow up I will have many different experiences that will impact me and change my genetic makeup. In addition, even though every individual has a similar genetic makeup, they may still differ greatly in terms of their experiences and circumstances. For instance, I might have had a great time growing up, while someone else might have been less successful at school and thus learned fewer valuable skills.

There's no one \"uniform\" thing out there, there's an infinite variety of different things, some better than others.  That's why we need to study everything we can get our hands on and understand them, because if we only know how things work in one direction, we won't even know how they work in any other direction.  That's the point of science - studying every aspect of the universe and trying to figure out how everything fits together.  In short, the universe isn't uniform; it's all different, so we need to try to understand it.  So, yes, my view is that we shouldn't assume anything about the way the universe works just because we've seen it in one place.  It doesn't mean we should ignore it entirely, though - if we find evidence that contradicts the idea that the laws of physics apply uniformly throughout the universe, we'll probably have to revisit the theory again and again until we get it right", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_3i74qy", "utterance_id": "t1_cudzyte", "response_tokens": 30, "context_tokens": 467}}

I also believe that this is reprehensible. Your ability to learn and be edified, I feel, is directly hindered by self-confidence.\n\nIn my experience, I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can, and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw, but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.\n\nConsequently, I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith, and quite another to be a fanatic, but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence. It is also possible to speak with some measure of certainty about your interests and knowledge, but it is usually best, I feel, to be prepared to re-examine your perspectives on even fundamental beliefs at any moment.\n\nThese perspectives, I do not feel, have served me very well. I find myself despising confident people as they speak with pride about things they have never once questioned. I see people rewarded for never once considering the ramifications of their actions or words simply because they convey confidence. It seems that many use someone's confidence as a measure for how correct or successful they are, when if anything, to me, it conveys only willful ignorance. What am I missing?

Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation.

If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error.

I believe that crowdfunding no matter the reason is stupid. I think it is lazy and a waste of time and money on both the requesting person's part and those who donate money to whatever it is they are sending money towards. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, crowdsourcing is lazy in my opinion. Now in a capitalist society, people start a business with an idea or vision, then fund their ideas with their own personal money, though a few family members or friends may feel free/happy to give some money or help with said business idea. For example if I wanted to open a coffee shop in town, I'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though I wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. With crowdfunding, I feel like you're essentially begging for money via the internet. It's the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. I think if you have an idea and you want to make it happen, you should be get it done yourself without begging your 200 Facebook friends for money. For example, one of my friends that I've known for years decided she wanted to go find the identity of her biological parents. She was adopted as an infant and doesn't know who her biological parents are. So she started a crowdfunding campaign asking for $2,000 to cover the expenses of finding her parents through an adoption agency. If I were in her shoes, I'd never ask for other people's money, I'd pay the bill all by myself instead of asking for money from other people via Facebook.\n\nMy next point is, I think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they're giving money to.

I would argue that it is not a waste of time, but rather, it is the best way to learn about what you're doing. \n\nWhen I started working out, I had to work out every day. Even though it took me a while to realize that I actually enjoyed the workout, there was still a lot of pressure to stay motivated (because we all know how much it takes to achieve results). That kind of pressure comes from feeling guilty because someone else has paid for your workouts and they're telling you to stop exercising. By choosing to exercise, you're making sure that you'll keep improving and feel good about yourself. There's nothing wrong with feeling bad about yourself when you're not doing what you want, just focus on moving forward. \n\nIf you take away the motivation to continue, you won't be", "response_2": "&gt; But what about the people who would actually contribute?  Is there not a large percentage of the population who are willing to put up money?\n\nNo, but when you look at how much money is donated by individual donors, the vast majority of the donations are given by people who don't care enough about the project to even consider the impact that their donation will have. This is because most of these individuals are either single adults who have little disposable income or are young college students looking for a job and need a paycheck. They're not interested in helping the cause because they simply aren't motivated enough. That's why many projects fail - because too many people are unmotivated enough to support the project and not enough people are motivated enough to support it.\n\nI agree that funding projects isn't always easy, but I'm not saying that funding projects is useless. The fact of the matter is, we need more people to volunteer their time and effort into the cause. We also need people to be inspired by our causes to take action. When you see someone else taking action against a problem, it motivates you to take action. People need to be motivated by others before they will take action.

The whole idea of boy/girl and man/woman is just a product of gender roles and stereotypes. You can't be a man (person with a penis) and \"feel\" like a woman simply because you like to shop and play with barbies and wear dresses. You can't be a woman (person with a vagina) and \"feel\" like a man just because you like sports and beer.

Yes, there may be difficulties, such as discrimination or finding a partner, but that's something that you just have to deal with. To me, it seems like the equivalent of a black man getting surgery to become white because he is discriminated against/wants to be with a white woman who does not want him because he is black. \n\nI think getting a sex change is extreme conformity, something that these people advocate against. Because they don't agree with the way society portrays their gender, they change their anatomy to match the one society says they should have.

For example, I am an agender transgender. That means I identify with both genders. This might sound strange, but it actually makes life much easier. When I was younger, I didn't feel comfortable identifying as either male or female. So instead of feeling like I had to live my entire life with someone who identified with only one gender, I decided to choose neither. I became agender.

In a time when so many are rejecting basic science, it's good to see a TV franchise that can romanticize the actual pursuit of science. My only reservation here is that it doesn't portray a balanced view that would promote sustainability in current behavior practices, making the future look far rosier than it will actually be.\n\nThat said, some of my reservations are on the cultural side of things. Culturally, the Star Trek mantra containing \"...to seek out new life and new civilizations\" is problematic because it suggests a fairly human-centric and ethnocentric view of the universe. The underlying implication is that a civilization is new until humanity meets it. It would have been inappropriate in Columbus' era to call the First Peoples a new civilization simply because Europeans had not yet met them, so it's equally problematic for this mentality to exist in the future.\n\nThe next issue I have is about the gender typing that the show has. While series subsequent to the original series don't exude sexism the way that Kirk's sexcapades did, there are underlying messages that are questionable each series. The majority of the characters are male, and each iteration of the show has some overly sexualized female character. The shows try to portray the women as strong, but they cannot get beyond certain portrayals of women as in need of help.

However, it's important to recognize that, as with any historical period, there is a lot of material and culture that has been lost over the course of history, including the history of Star Trek.  \n\nAdditionally, I think your argument holds up well against the idea that \"we're not living in a perfect world,\" which is a very broad statement.  There are countless ways to live our lives without being a threat to the environment.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't strive to protect ourselves and those around us, however.  \n\nIn short, I think that Star Trek offers a useful reminder to the present, as long as we take the time to learn how to live with it and make the most of the opportunities that it presents.", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1xny71", "utterance_id": "t1_cfd5xiw", "response_tokens": 88, "context_tokens": 455}}

To explain, I'd like to propose a couple of short thought experiment:\n\nA man walks in a museum and comes across three identical, photorealistic images hanging on the wall. His friend told him that one is a photograph, one is a painting, and one is a CGI rendering, but you can't tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods, they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. \n\nThe image in the middle is the photograph. \"This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen, *I* could've taken that.\" \n\nThe image on the left is the CGI rendering. \"Well, I guess you can do anything on a computer these days.\" \n\nThe image on the right is the painting. \"Wow, I can't believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece!\" \n\nA museum guide comes over, looks at the information plates, and says: \"I'm sorry sir, someone changed these plates again.

I know that's a bit of a weird question to ask, but you've said it yourself - it's because it feels like something special, unique and different from other paintings. For me personally, I think that's what makes a piece of art great - it feels like a special moment, and it adds a layer of meaning to it.

If the region were able to reach a self-sustainable population (whether by being able to produce food to feeds its people or to afford to import the food itself) would this not solve the problem of world hunger?\n\nComment 1: As Mrs.Pontellier pointed out, there is a sufficient supply of food globally to prevent starvation. The market of food is quite globalized, since we have big price adjustments when something changes in the American Great Plains or some parts of Brazil. It's unnecessary for a region to be self-sufficient, moreover cities have never been self-sufficient in food. The Roman Empire was partially defined by each province specializing in a different staple food crop and using the Mediterranean to trade back and forth.\n\nThe big famines now have two components, both of which are necessary for famine:\n1) Environmental Disaster: Droughts, floods, plague, or war that suppresses local production.\n2) Human Disaster: War, widespread disaster, or corruption that suppresses trade and aid shipments.\n\nYou haven't seen widespread starvation in Western Europe or the United States in centuries not associated with a World War in centuries. Why? Because when the natural disaster occurs trade and charity fills the gap. You do see famine where governments are hostile to the notion of aid, such as Ukraine in the 1920's, governments steal the aid for feeding soldiers, such as North Korea or the Congo, or there isn't a government at all and some competitors are openly hostile to everyone, such as China after the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 or the Sudan since 1991.\n\nBy addressing the failures of government you can eliminate most major famines. By strengthening local charity and local economies you can greatly speed up this process.\n\nMoreover, letting people starve wouldn't resolve the issue of famine, because it'\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think that's what makes a famine a famine, regardless of who's causing it. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with famine, if it's caused by human activity and not environmental disasters.

They're not seeking assistance from those who are willing to help them, but rather from those who will give money to a person desperate enough to ask for it.\n\nYes, but it also means that the recipient does not know how to make use of the help that is given, and so he/she will continue to suffer without help. In short, it doesn't work as a solution.\n\n&gt;But even if you want to argue against this, there are some things you could say that won't actually change anything:\n\n- There's no reason why you couldn't be more efficient at getting aid than the government can be\n\n- Some people who are suffering may be able to find alternative ways of obtaining aid", "response_2": "&gt; But what about the problems within the nations themselves?

The diplomatic way also makes sense, since you can be made a world leader through the world congress.

This is like the Wikipedia article states: \"If the player decides to build [a new invention], he or she must first use the available resources to purchase the necessary materials.\" \n\nSo, if you build a spaceship and some kind of nuclear reactor, the player gets to decide whether or not to use that material to further develop his or her civilization.

This is certainly true of the game, but it's a concept which was never really fully realized. It seems like it may only become more and more important over time, but it's not something that can be fully implemented without taking away from the experience of playing the game. \n\nIt's interesting that the game isn't actually focused on the specific idea of a \"cultural victory\", but rather on how you get around winning every single battle against all other civilizations (or at least those with similar cultures). That being said, it does seem like the concept of a \"cultural victory\" is very hard to define exactly, and thus I think it's worth having a discussion on it. \nI'd love to hear other opinions on it though!\n\nEdit: I don't think the term \"cultural victory\" is used correctly here.

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I think that's what makes psychosis different from normality, in that it seems to me that there is something about how we perceive reality that is at least partially determined by our evolutionarily advantageous traits, and so is somehow related to how our brains have been shaped over time. \n\nWell, you might find the following article [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170645/) interesting. It describes a study that looks at the neural correlates of psychosis. As you can see, even though the patients were able to report being aware of their own presence, there was still an observable reduction in the ability of the patients to perform tasks that required them to maintain awareness. The researchers suggest this could be due to reduced access to information, but perhaps not entirely. They propose that the patients' inability to perceive themselves as part of a real world environment was responsible for their impaired awareness.\n\n&gt; If you're a neuroscientist, then yes, the answer to your question would be 'yes'.

Or you could take a different definition of 'real'.\n\nIn any case, there's a difference between saying 'we're all in our own private worlds' and saying 'there's\nno way we're ever in each others' real lives', both of which imply that people are somehow limited in their access to the 'unconspicuous realities' surrounding them.

I'd like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest, before discussing the pros and cons, and moral implications.\n\nThe reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. \n\nAlso, there is no choice. If you want a loan, or have a bank account, you MUST pay/receive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds: therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this?

If interest rates went back to what they were in 1960, unemployment might drop below 5%, which would allow many people to start saving. However, even then it's just an illusion. Interest rates haven't gone down much since 1960. In fact, it's likely to go up. That's because interest rates are tied to inflation, and inflation hasn't gone down since 1960 either. \n\nIn any case, I don't see any reason to ban interest, and indeed there are reasons why you shouldn't ban it. One thing I can think of is that banks are often run by corrupt individuals who use their position to get loans and kick out people who want to borrow money. But if interest rates went back to the pre-inflation levels, it would mean more people couldn't afford housing or food, which would be bad enough anyway.

However, since we do use money as a medium of exchange and storage, we don't need money to perform any of the functions mentioned. For example, many banks today exist solely to provide credit. Without the ability to lend money, we could never afford to buy food. And we can't afford to eat meat either. This is just one example, but I think the point is clear enough.  \n\nThere are a few more reasons why money isn't necessary:\n\n1. The value of money is determined by supply and demand. If everyone had access to money, then everyone could spend whatever they wanted. This is probably a much better situation than we're currently living in. \n\n2.

(By all means, show me data otherwise, i'm looking to give away a Delt)\n\nFormula isn't as good for baby, and it causes undue financial distress, but unfortunately is easier for new mothers. Breastfeeding is hard work, especially for new mothers, so oftentimes (In America, at least) we abandon hope of breastfeeding and switch to formula within the first day. formula companies stock hospitals and line doctors' pockets in order to rope new, frustrated mothers into the formula easy-train.

The issue comes down to whether or not the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nI understand that there are people who would argue that there aren't any studies showing that Formula is superior to Breast Milk. In fact, many studies have been done comparing both types of milk. While some of these studies have shown that formula does not produce more calories than breast milk, most studies have concluded that the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the cost.\n\nIt might help to know that I am not arguing that Formula is *better* than Breast Milk. That would be too extreme. What I am arguing is that it *isn't* better because it's cheaper to buy Formula than Breast Milk.\n\nSo, if you don't want to read the above link, I'd like to point out one thing:\n\n> \n> According to a recent study by Dr. David J.

When you hold your chopstick in your hand, it bends and sways slightly depending on how far you lean it.  It also works differently when holding it against your body since you'll need to bend over a little bit and the metal part of the stick sways back and forth.\n\nThe main reason most people use chopsticks is because they make cutting easier.  Chopsticks allow you to cut off small pieces of meat without damaging your fingers by making cuts.  In addition, the amount of force you can exert on a chopstick compared to an ordinary finger makes them an excellent tool for cutting large pieces of meat.  Since chopsticks can cut even larger pieces of meat, they are often used for cooking as well.

It is unfair that these children should suffer, and be affected for the rest of their life.\n\nWhy should we be allowed to raise a child just because we have the ability to make babies? Or if its considered a moral right, why? In practise, this mean that there should be some sort of test/points system (I couldn't say the best way), to determine if the couple is fit to look after a child. Normally, since abuse is a minority issue, I would say that a blacklist system works better (fit to rear a child until proven otherwise), however, when you are dealing with someone's life, abuse is such a long lasting effect that I suggest a white list system.\n\nEdit: I did not mean to imply eugenics, but I see how it seems I would support it\n\nEdit2: Would just like to say I love you guys, really insightful and provoking stuff, I'll probably find some more of my views I'm not totally comfortable with to post later.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I do not think that there is a clear line between abuse and parenting and that a blacklisting system is appropriate.\n\nThis is a very broad statement.

Even if you can identify the abuser, what about the innocent victim who has been raped?

So unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that a parent committed abuse, then you wouldn't necessarily know whether they were acting out of bad intentions or out of guilt over past wrong-doing.  \n\n&gt; The point is that the government does not want parents to have free rein to abuse their kids.

If your income is below the median, then you can't afford to pay for the schooling costs.

They just go \"Wow, that's such an idiotic action!\"\n\nThat is true, but that doesn't explain why they still want to be around that person even if they are feeling upset. The fact that they feel upset or angry when they look at that person is a symptom of the fact that they are feeling emotional pain. That is why crying isn't the answer here.\n\n&gt; If we are able to recognize a trigger, then we need to know what type of trigger it is. Is there anything that causes us to feel sad, angry, scared, etc.? Does it cause us to react emotionally? Can it be prevented or controlled?\n\nThe idea that we cannot control our emotions is a common belief in psychology.

The ball cannot touch anyone or anything else until after the throw has occurred. The player who receives the ball is free to run with it, shoot a pass, or whatever they want, and then immediately drop the ball back to the other team. This is essentially the same thing as saying that in football, if the referee doesn't call a goal, the play goes on as normal, and whoever throws the ball wins. It's not the same as saying that if a penalty is called, it means that the play has ended and the opponent is allowed to continue with possession. That wouldn't make sense either way. \n\nIn soccer, the ball is tied to the ground by the defender and must remain tied to the ground while the ball is being thrown.

For those that, god forbid, don't already know:\n\n&gt;[A calzone (/kælˈzoʊni/, US /kælˈzoʊneɪ/, or /kælˈzoʊn/, UK /kælˈtsoʊni/; Italian: [kalˈtsoːne], \"stocking\" or \"trouser\") is an Italian filled oven bread, originating in Naples, and shaped as a folded pizza. It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone) \n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones. \n\n5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible, but are rarely seen in the pizza world.

I still have a few questions though:  \n\n1) If you could only make one dish, what would it be?  Do you think a pizza could ever become something that is enjoyed outside of Italy?\n\n2) What about the difference between a traditional pizza and a calzone?

I've heard things like \"the pan makes the crust crispier\" (which sounds promising), but I haven't found evidence that I can see supporting that claim.\n\n4) I suppose another question would be whether calzones would have the same appeal outside of Italy.  Would they be even more attractive if they were used in France, Spain, Portugal, etc.?

That makes it different from a pizza. \n\nYou're right, however, that I haven't considered this before - thanks for clarifying!

The first advantage is the ease of transporting. A calzone is easier to carry around than a traditional pizza since it is only 90% filled with dough.

They're often very physically demanding, requiring a large amount of physical strength and endurance. There are countless stories about athletes who were injured in their early years only to be forced to go through intense training, which may have given them a greater appreciation for what they're doing. And yet, even after all those years, they still seem to enjoy their sport immensely. \n\nThis is true. I personally think it does help develop your body, but I find that it doesn't necessarily make it easy to enjoy it. For example, while watching my favorite game, I couldn't sit still long enough to watch another game. The reason is simply because the sport demands so much concentration, attention to detail, and skill.

The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow; we do not choose our genes, and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce, a right to bodily autonomy, that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual; no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective, it is *wrong* if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning, and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The 'individual' does not exist; we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control (our genetic code, our upbringing in childhood, the societies in which we live). In turn, our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future, shape the future families and societies. This being realized, it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individual's self-interested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the [invisible hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand). Of course, Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns, which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.\n\nThroughout history we have been shown that in a competitive, individualized society, [that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce.

Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think this is because there's no inherent right to kill or eat animals.

If we want to raise them we're free to raise them.\n\nNot true. Not by any means. It's quite common for humans to kill animals which aren't being used for food, clothing, etc. As long as they're not in captivity, the act is still unethical. If you're talking about a species which has been hunted down to extinction, that would be different. In that case you're making up your own ethics, and it might even be morally wrong to continue killing that species. The difference between those two examples is whether the act was intentional, or unintentional.\n\nIn both cases, you're doing something you shouldn't be doing. There's nothing inherently wrong with killing animals for their fur, skin, hides, bones, etc. It's just that you shouldn't be doing it, and if you were, you'd probably be guilty of murder.\n\n&gt;If we want to raise them we're free to raise them\n\nThat's fine.

It's a waste of lives and resources to just throw them away. If you'd rather just kill them, then by all means do so. But if you really care about their wellbeing, you'll want to keep them alive until you find a way to get rid of them.\n\nIf you'd prefer to leave them alone, then you'd better be able to find another way to feed them before they die.\n\n&gt; And there's no need for it to even hurt them because it's just being a hunter\n\nI suppose I'm not sure how much more cruelty this would cause. Hunting does seem crueler than farming or factory farming. But it still feels good to kill something, so maybe we shouldn't try to eliminate the feeling of satisfaction we get from killing. If that's true then I think the only way to satisfy our hunger for meat will be to increase the number of animals hunted and kill less.

There is always benefit to considering you are wrong.

Let me explain:\n\n* If we had no military, then it wouldn't make sense for us to have a secessionist state.  We don't need any troops for our army.  \n* But, if we do have a secessionist state, why would we go to war?  If we're having trouble getting troops, then we might as well not have them at all.  It's better to keep our resources focused on domestic issues.  \n\nIf we were talking about a civil war, I'd argue that we would probably end up fighting each other over the rights to use their own land (which could lead to a lot of bloodshed, even without any military conflict).\n\nBut, if we're talking about a secessionist state, how can we justify leaving the rest of the country to deal with the problems?

Then the whole country would have had a majority vote for secession. So let's assume the South was part of the United States long after its founding. Let's also assume that there were no wars or conflicts during this period between the two countries. We know these are false assumptions, but we'll ignore them now. \n\nNow, let's consider how the South would react. If the South had been an independent state at the time of the Civil War, then it could have voted against secession. This is because the South would have been part of the Union at that time, and they would not have been able to take advantage of the fact that the war was taking place.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word *mariage*, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *marītāre*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. \n\nNow moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  \n\nNow I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  \n\n[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikiped\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "I think the argument that \"Marriage\" is religious is a little flawed. It's a term that has been used since at least the beginning of Christianity (which started with a priest giving out a marriage certificate).

I don't think there's an argument here against it being religious.\n\nThe fact that it's a term that exists only within the church isn't particularly strong evidence for or against the claim that it is religious. I think it's pretty clear that the majority of Christians would agree that it's not religious. \n\nAs far as my point about the term itself going away, that's true. However, the term isn't being used like that anymore. As long as it's accepted as a religious concept, it will probably be used that way forever. There are some cases where it was used outside of the church, such as in law, but those are exceptions rather than the general case.

It makes sense for us to use the word \"chicken,\" but it's just as illogical to say \"duck,\" because ducks were also domesticated species. There's no reason why there shouldn't be an equivalent word for Marriage, or even better, for all of marriage. So I'd suggest renaming Marriage to something like \"Marriage Practice.\" \n\nI agree that the word \"chicken\" isn't going away any time soon. It's probably going to stay around forever (unless some new invention takes over), but it's certainly not going to become the dominant noun in the language.

Rich people will finance and give so much more opportunities (education, experiences, contacts, influence) to many generations of their offspring, how young people can compete equally so their merit will decide who deserves what and gives the best individuals of a society the top positions!?. Only moral heritage should be valid.\n\nComment 1: I will agree with the important of preventing an aristocratic class from accumulating most of the nation's wealth (oops, too late), but banning inheritance entirely is a mistake for the following reasons:\n\n* Funerals cost money, as does end of life care. These expenses can range up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is unlikely to be available in liquid assets for most, and leaving families on the hook for these costs when the dying person had the physical resources (perhaps a house that could be sold) to pay for it eventually is unethical.\n\n* Sometimes specific items have sentimental value. I own a violin that belonged to my great grandfather at the time he immigrated from Europe to the US, and though it isn't worth much, you can bet that I want to pass it on to my own kids someday. This would not change if the violin were instead worth $100k. Artworks could easily fall into this category while being worth much more.\n\n* Many people who grow up poor and struggle into the middle class do so in part out of a drive to leave their children with more than they had. They want to improve their family's lot. If there is no more material heritage, this drive is eliminated. \n\nIn order to level the playing field and establish a meritocracy, I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on, and, crucially, at the same time provide services for health care, education, and child support through taxes so that even the poorest of children have a real opportunity to succeed. \n\nThe playing field will never truly be equal, because successful parents don't just come with money, but with connections to other successful people. Their children will benefit from these connections regardless of material inheritance, and there's not really anything to do about it.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on\n\nSo if I am a wealthy man, I have no problem with someone giving me a mansion or a beach vacation.

I'm guessing that this is because you believe that charitable donations should be given without regard to their donors' financial status. However, there's nothing wrong with charitable donations made by rich people - if you're happy with your charity being done by someone who has a high income, then that's fine by me.\n\nNow, if you're saying that you don't believe that charitable donations should be given without regard to their donors' financial status, then I think that you're basically making a case against \"meritocracy\".

I find it very disturbing that people who claim to be supporting \"social progress\" in society want to begin delimiting and banning thinkers who already exist as a minority that rests outside the norm of consensual decency.  \n\nYou cannot use a principle of liberal social democracy, and then turn around and illiberally and antisocially try to close the door behind you.   This understanding that freedom of speech is \"good while it benefits us, but bad when it doesn't\" is exactly the reason why it must exist, and was the very mechanism that gave us social progress: to allow individuals or minority groups to challenge the group-think of the masses.  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But, even though they're different, they aren't mutually exclusive.  In fact, they can coexist in a democratic society, if both are adhered to.

The principles of liberty, democracy, and equality are all relative to the context and are subject to change.

At first I fought against it, trying to argue my position, and I thought that I was doing well, but I just got called names and mocked for it.

I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch.

It seems to me that you can't argue against what you believe to be true, even if you find a counterexample. So, you must be convinced by something that you didn't actually prove yourself wrong by. That's what I mean when I say \"you can't argue against what you believe to be true.\"\n\nIf you don't feel like arguing against anything, then maybe you shouldn't bother making claims at all.

How does it affect your gameplay?\n\nYou're right, it's just not as fun. There's a reason why everyone likes their mouse and keyboard. If someone was going to try out a controller, they'd probably find one that worked better for their specific needs. A keyboard and mouse work great for *most* games. In fact, they work great for most games. It's just that some games are better suited for one or the other, and sometimes they're both good. For example, I love the feel of a keyboard, but I don't like how my mouse feels. So I keep mine in the middle. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy your gaming experience by combining mouse and keyboard, though. Just don't expect them to be perfect.

Well, I'm certainly not accidentally unattractive -- I'm in great shape, I dress in flattering, fitted clothing, and I take care of my hygiene. As far as \"be attractive\", I'm average, which shouldn't hurt or help me either way. I have my minor flaws in appearance, but so does everyone.\n\nI'm not looking for a supermodel genius.

This would increase efficiency when driving without sacrificing safety very much, IMO. I feel like when I drive there are a vast number of occasions when it would be *completely* safe for me to go through the intersection, but it’s technically illegal until the light turns green. I’m sure the majority of other drivers experience similar situations. This wastes everyone’s time and even money (gas is burned while idling). This is especially true in the middle of night when there are times when you’re the only vehicle on the road where you’re driving. \n\nThis obviously wouldn't work at every intersection, as some intersections just have too much traffic going in too many directions, so here's my disclaimer that I agree there are exceptions. However, I do think these intersections could have a \"no turn on red from 7 AM - 6 PM\" or something, rather than a hard rule. I see signs like this in the city all the time. This way when there is no traffic at 3 AM people aren’t just idling at red lights for 2-3 minutes.

For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:\n\n* Article 3\n\n&gt; Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\n\nIf one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as \"dishonouring the family\" or \"acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman\". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:\n\n&gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her \"guardian\", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.\n\nBecause of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant.

I'm not sure what you're saying about the rights of women in Saudi Arabia. What I don't understand is why the men would want to take away the rights of women simply because they believe they are entitled to it. I feel like the reason is because some of the laws they enforce on women aren't based on the fact that they were married before, but rather upon whether they've ever committed an act that they consider to be wrong. \n\nIn short, I think your view is incorrect. The right to freedom of speech is not something that you can just decide on its own. It's something that needs to be backed up by law. I suppose you're correct though, that women are not equal to men in terms of the rights they have.

In fact, many countries in the world (especially those with Muslim populations) treat women much worse than Saudi Arabia. I mean, look at the US.

I also don't want a big wedding, or to have children, so I guess you could say that i'm not very traditional. I have no problem buying a plain ring or a ring with an alternative to diamonds, as long as it's under a couple of hundred euros.\n\nThe main reason I don't want to buy an engagement ring is money. They are ridiculusly overpriced. I'm not willing to pay a couple of grand for a shiny rock. I think the money could be much better spent on a a great holiday, or to help start your married life together. \n\nAlso, I think that diamonds are a sham.

That your prospective life partner doesn't think you're worth it, if they don't buy you a shiny rock. This materialistic urge that is drilled into people fom a young age, by people who stand to profit from it, is something I don't buy into, and don't want to comply with or encourage. \n\nI want my view changed because all the women in my family disagree with me, and i'm \nworried about it leading to relationship problems down the line.\n\nEdit: My view has been partially changed in some ways.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:\n\nFirst, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. \n\nSecond of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. \n\nAll in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are usef\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I do not think you can get rid of capitalism and socialism in one go because they both have flaws\n\nI agree that they are flawed, however if we want to keep capitalism intact, then we need to have a government that controls it. As you pointed out in your post, this is what China did. This is a major step forward, as it allowed the Chinese economy to grow without being dominated by any foreign companies. So I don't see how you could call China \"socialist\". \n\nHowever, my main point is that you can only implement a society's principles through the actions of those within that society. As long as they fail, the society fails too. There is a big difference between a society failing and the actions taken within it failing. The same goes for socialism - when it fails, it fails in the actions of those who control it.\n\nIn short, socialism is not inherently bad - it's just that it's difficult to make it work properly without outside interference. But the only way it can ever succeed is through the actions of those who control it. For example, China's economy has grown tremendously over the last 20 years, partly because of their policy of allowing more private enterprise. They've done this by putting themselves under tight economic", "response_2": "&gt; But what about the problems you're talking about?  Is socialism not working?\n\nI don't see how it can, except to say that if we get rid of communism, capitalism would be able to provide a better quality of life to most people.\n\nBut I'm sure there will be some issues with economic inequality, but I don't think that they can be fixed by socialism. For one thing, it's hard to predict which industries will be good for socialism and which ones will not.  For example, I could foresee a time when there wouldn't be any need for the public transportation system because cars and trucks would be more efficient and cheaper to run.  So I'd expect the government to step in and put in place public transport.  But if that happens, the result would be less pollution, lower cost for the average citizen, and a healthier populace.\n\nIn terms of income equality, I think it depends on the amount of income disparity within society.  If there is a large gap between rich and poor, then you may want to look at redistribution programs like food stamps.  Or perhaps some form of progressive taxation where wealthier individuals pay more taxes than those with lesser incomes.\n\nFor education, I think it's difficult to make socialism a success.", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_3cntuq", "utterance_id": "t1_csxgfb6", "response_tokens": 241, "context_tokens": 443}}

No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would.

If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with \"hey are you okay?\" and \"Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave.\" That to me is hypocritical.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: I believe that absolute values for moral and immoral behavior exist, and that every action is in fact made up of several separate moral and immoral components. Within this system moral behavior could be broadly described as that which endeavors to aid the human race, protect life and human rights, and preserve a healthy environment for the prolonged future of the species. Immoral behaviors could be similarly defined as those which are purposed to bring death or injury to another, those which benefit one member or subset of the human race at the expense of another, those which actively neglect another human in need, or otherwise do physical, emotional, spiritual or other harm to humans on any scale.\n\n\nFor example, a police officer responds to an armed robbery in progress. In the course of discharging his duties he is forced to fire his weapon at the perpetrator, killing him, to prevent the death of the victim. The police officer has done both a moral act (in protecting the life and property of the establishment and victim) as well as an immoral one (in taking a human life).\n\n\nObviously this system is flawed and the various \"shades of grey\" become harder and harder to distinguish in higher-order situations (such as making an immoral decision to preserve resources for a later, larger moral decision; or else the only \"pure white\" path through life would be to give away everything you own and wander the world doing what good you could without ever keeping anything for yourself). Personally, however, I take issue with the fact that I can't come up with a scenario which allows for one to realistically make it through life without making immoral choices.\n\n\nAll thoughts appreciated, of course, but specifically I'm looking for things which help me reconcile the fact that I'm pretty much doomed to make immoral choices and can't do anything about it. That could be showing me a way to work my system to \"live white,\" convincing me that the black/white line is in a different place than I believe, showing me how to be ok with living some shade of grey, or whatever else you brilliant folks come up with.

But I think that the problem lies not with the lack of a perfect answer, but with the fact that there isn't even a single answer that works everywhere.

For starters, I think you're right that people can choose to make different decisions based on their personal preferences, interests, etc., and that they shouldn't have to pick between two completely incompatible choices.

But the problem isn't with your reasoning about the morality of our actions, it's with your reasoning about the morality of our motivations.  As long as our actions don't violate laws and ethical norms that everyone agrees to, then we shouldn't care about them, so long as we don't violate any of our own rules.  This makes it very easy to get into a situation where you're going to try to justify something you've done that violates your own rules.  Of course, once you realize this, you'll probably start to doubt your own beliefs too. \n\nThat said, if you want to think about morality, then you will need to develop a set of principles that you can apply to your own decisions.

He does have to put in some hours, but it is still less than being able to make a living by working for a company and earning a salary. \n\nBut if you want to be a plumber, you're better off hiring someone else who is good at plumbing and paying them decently. So why is it that people choose to hire people who are more qualified than them, when they know that their own skills are superior?\n\nWhat happens is that once they decide to hire someone, the employer then takes on the costs of training, insurance, etc. The employer pays for their own equipment, which they use themselves. They pay for their own wages, so they earn what they deserve. Once the employer is happy with how their employee performs, then they can let the employee start making profits.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: ## Section I: Why is Basic Income Increasingly Popular? \n\n\"Basic income\" is a policy that has broad support from both the progressive left and libertarian right. Center-left economists including Paul Krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. First, BI is an effective anti-poverty measure. BI also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. Perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that BI provides people with \"freedom.\" Left-libertarian political economist Philippe Van Parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have \"access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do.\" BI provides people those means. Some have made a feminist case for BI. Philosopher Carole Pateman writes, BI \"would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.\"\n\nBasic income, particularly in the form of a \"negative income tax,\" is also popular among the libertarian right. With a NIT in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, Medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. It would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the \"unemployment trap\" that occurs under the existing system. Also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. \"Benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn’t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,\" University of San Diego's Matt Zwolinski writes. A basic income, Zwolinski continues, would change that. Basic income is \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. If they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. But the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. Conservatives also like \"basic income\" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I think that's what makes BI appealing - it's a way to reduce poverty and improve living standards while still protecting individual rights.\n\nBut this is not what I was asking for. What I'm looking for is something more substantive. The point I am making is that there are benefits to BI which are not present with any other social program currently in existence. \n\nI don't understand why anyone would oppose BI. It sounds like a great idea. I know many people who support BI but can't come around to it because of its costs or inequities. I've seen some really nice statistics about BI being beneficial, but I haven't been able to find the source of those numbers. \n\nIf someone else had said this before I'd have gotten my head around it. My view hasn't changed since I read your post though. I'll see you guys again sometime.

It wasn't practical enough to win over my party members at the time. In fact, when I ran against a candidate who supported it, he got only 5% of the votes. \n\nBut I think this isn't really the problem with basic income. \n\nIn many places, the idea is actually going forward with little or no opposition. The big issue is the implementation. That's where things start getting tricky. \n\nHere's my view:\n\n* Most states currently don't offer any basic income programs. So there's no way to implement them yet.\n* There are two options available. One is to raise taxes to fund basic income. This is the only option that can work in the long run since raising taxes will eventually reduce our standard of living. However, raising taxes may mean that more people won't be able to afford basic necessities, which could create a vicious circle. \n* The second option is to pass laws that make it easier for people to receive benefits.

I hear a great number of people raving about \"sherlock\" and don't ever hear anyone talking about \"elementary.\"\nThey are both airing at the same time in our culture, and both have to do with retellings of the sherlock Holmes story.\n\nElementary deserves more praise than Sherlock in short because Elementary is filled with more dynamic and deep story telling.\nTake just the first meeting of Sherlock and Watson in each show. In Elementary, Holmes has recently been a drug addict, addicted to heroine who has now fought to sobriety. This sets up the fateful meeting between him and Watson (played by Lucy Liu) who is working as a sober companion. Why is Dr Watson a sober companion? Because she made a 1 in a 10000 (or something) mistake that took the life of her patient. Leaving her without the confidence to perform surgery. She still wants to help people and therefore goes into sober companionship which eventually leads to being Holmes's underling.\n\nThe characters are burdened by deep emotions that they are constantly fighting in order to save the city suffice it to say.\n\nIn Sherlock, the meeting between Holmes and Watson is more of a \"just get on with it\" sort of deal. As Watson is walking through the park, sees an old friend, who happens to know Sherlock. They are both looking for a roommate and voila..they meet and go on adventures together.\n\nThere are other examples but I'll stop there before I spend all night writing!\n\nSo CMV, convince me that the BBC version is just as in depth, better, more interesting...what have you more so than elementary.\nYes the subjective nature of the art form is up for debate and that's why you can pick which way you think the BBC version is better than the CBS one.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not saying that Elementary is superior to Sherlock, but I do believe that the plot was executed differently.\n\nYou're right, I've seen lots of similar things happen on television lately.

It was done very well by its creator, and I'd love to see it improve upon it further. \n\nBut what I want to ask is this: Is there any reason to doubt the accuracy of the plot in Elementary? If you're going to tell the story from your own point of view, and that's how Sherlock works, then you're doing a terrible job.

The issue isn't whether Sherlock sells more copies than Elementary, it's whether it makes more money, does it make sense economically, and if it does, does it do enough to justify the cost of production?\n\nYou've got some good points here, but it's worth noting that while the series was hugely successful, it wasn't really the first thing that came to mind when I watched it. It was the second episode of the show that made me think that I'd like to see another Sherlock, and my reaction to the third episode was quite different from mine to the previous two episodes. \n\nIt seems that the success of the show is tied to its popularity. If the show was more obscure or less popular, then people would probably find it boring and it wouldn't have the same effect. On the flip side, if it were more popular, it could attract a larger audience, increase viewership and potentially even generate more revenue.

Nigeria passed an incredibly homophobic law this January, and Uganda and Kenya have followed suit. The long and short of it is that if I tried to live openly back home, I would be put in prison for any period of time ranging from between 10 and 14 years. \n\nI realize that this law and others like it are possibly in violation of several human rights declarations which these countries have ostensibly ratified. I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end.\n\nHowever, as people who follow this issue are aware, the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa, which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position (i.e., that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion, which itself is a Western import), and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations, and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West, the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa, and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations, but (I was surprised to learn) is actually criminalized in the US and Canada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so, then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone.\n\nI'm not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so if a woman/man decides to marry another man/woman with an existing spouse, it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it.\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not\n \nYou seem to be making a distinction between \"consenting\" and \"informed.\"  \n\n&gt;and for the West to respect their laws\n\nThat's what you're asking. \n\n&gt;it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it\n\nThis is true!

I would mention that I think it is primarily a problem of nomenclature and the stigmas that are associated with mental illness, things that shouldn’t but do affect the DSM, as I can’t think of a logical reason that homosexuality isn’t considered a mental illness (based on the conventions below) – end disclaimer**\n\n\nThe definition I find most prevalent in conversations with my colleagues for a mental illness is basically:\n\n**A neural disorder or deviation from the norm that leads to disadvantageous behavior or thought processing, or other negative cognitive effects for the individual.**\n\n\nAs I understand it, the current prevailing belief with regards to the origin of homosexuality is that there is a hormonal error in utero. The fetus isn’t exposed to the correct level of hormones at the proper critical periods that would cause heterosexual development. (If this is wrong, please correct me)\n\nIf this is the case, then I \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by \"the origin of homosexuality\" and whether it's possible to say it has an underlying hormonal issue. But one thing I do know for certain is that there's no scientific evidence to support it being a mental illness.\n\n&gt; There's nothing scientifically supported about why it is a mental illness? Or, if it is, then it seems to be a mental illness.\n\nTo address your first point, I believe it is a fact that there IS some genetic basis for homosexuality. As for the second, I'm still unsure. If you're talking about a biological explanation, then yes, that does seem to be true. My colleague who works with this subject told me he hasn't heard anything that directly supports this theory. He just believes that there may be a hormonal issue that makes it harder for boys than girls to form close relationships. I haven't seen enough research to be convinced that this is a real issue.\n\n&gt; It was originally theorized that because of the hormone imbalance, the brain would develop differently between males and females. Then, when we became aware of this idea, we began to realize that there actually is a hormone imbalance in men and women. And that’s where the debate comes down to. \n\nThis is a", "response_2": "&gt;So I'm not sure why you'd say that.\n\nYou're not making sense.  I didn't state that homosexual is considered a mental illness.  That's just my opinion.  \n\nIt seems like your point about the hormonal errors is essentially irrelevant here.  What I mean is that I believe that people who are attracted to others aren't actually mentally ill, since they aren't experiencing these kinds of symptoms.  If we accept that, then why do we need to categorize them as having a \"mental illness\"?  It doesn't seem necessary.  And if we do need to categorize them, then why do we use the term?  I'd argue that it makes it easier to talk about it than it does to discuss the hormone issues that cause them.\n\n&amp;#8710;\n\nBut maybe I've misunderstood something.  Or perhaps I'm missing something.  Anyways, thanks for the input!  It really helped clarify some things.  I was able to get my head around the logic behind your argument now.  Thanks again!

But that doesn't make it a trigger.\n\n&gt; If you look at the pictures, you'll see that almost everyone around you is smiling and laughing even though you're crying. So there must be something in your mind which causes you to feel happy when you're around the people around you.\n\nThere may be. But it wouldn't be a trigger.\n\n&gt; In short, I believe that there's nothing special about the image itself, its just that people use it as a trigger for emotional responses.

Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.\n\nI don't think it's too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They aren't interested in making a monetary profit, they're interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video, you're showing them that there is demand for more of this content, and they've demonstrated they're willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people don't view the video out of respect for James.\n\nChild pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit, but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation, and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice, the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video.\n\nIt's interesting to me that everyone in the r/worldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal, while I'm fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. I'm not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal, I'm just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. \n\nOne argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity, while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content.

It seems to me that the point of the video isn't really about killing people, it's about making money.\n\nThat's true, though I think it might have something to do with the fact that I'd never heard of the idea before seeing the video. There were lots of examples of children being kidnapped and sold into slavery, but I didn't come across any videos where the kidnappers had already murdered the victim before the video came out. \n\n&gt; If we could prove that the video wasn't made from the crime scene, then I guess I'd say that it wouldn't be seen as pornographic because it wasn't done with the intent to make money.\n\nThat's exactly right! That's how I feel now. I think it's important to remember that even when someone commits a murder, they usually don't kill without premeditation (or at least not in the same way). In that sense, the act of murdering someone is still murder, no matter how it is carried out. Even if a video shows an innocent man getting shot by police, it's murder anyway.

It makes sense from a law enforcement perspective, but it also seems like a bad idea from a moral standpoint. Is it morally wrong to kill someone because you have the money to do it? Or is it morally wrong to murder someone because you have a religious belief in hell? Is it morally wrong to kill someone for no apparent reason at all?\n\nYou might argue that it doesn't matter if it's legal or illegal, since most people are capable of killing someone for no apparent reason. But then you'll say that it's immoral to kill someone for no apparent reason, because you don't feel any guilt about it. That's probably right, but isn't it immoral to kill someone for no apparent reason when you could have done something better?\n\nSo maybe we need a third option - one that doesn't involve killing someone for no apparent reason.

You can say what you want and not encounter any type of resistance, punishment or retribution that is within the confines of the law.\n\nBy nobody I don't mean one specific person. So maybe the prince of Aberjizan can say what he wants because he can have people killed with a wave of his hand, I mean a group of people. Or someone standing in the woods with nobody to hear them, that obviously doesn't count either and sort of relates to my final point on this about whether words matter or not.\n\nSo why I don't think anyone is free to say whatever they want, in the most simplistic terms. If you walk up to someone and tell them you are going to kill them they can shoot you in self defence. Perfectly legal and reasonable for them to do so if they believed you. But you were killed for only what you said...\n\nWhat I think this demonstrates; words have meaning. Words convey ideas, thoughts, plans and actions. If what you say didn't mean anything then what would be the point of saying anything? Thus if words have this meaning then surely you should be responsible for them? \n\nThat shit church that always pickets funerals for example, is entirely designed to evoke peoples anger to try and get them to disrupt them in a way they can sue for. They use words to incite violence against themselves, how can you not hold someone responsible for that? What if a politician makes a promise and then completely goes back on it?

Words can change lives, they're certainly a part of that, but they're not necessarily something which we need to take responsibility for. \n\nIf words matter, then by that standard, every single word spoken has an equal chance of having a positive or negative effect on life. In fact, every single word has an equal chance of causing harm or benefit, but it's the choice of words (and their intent) which matters. \n\nAs for \"responsibility\", I'd argue that if a person says something, then they've taken a step towards taking responsibility for what they said. The decision to speak, the decision to take responsibility for what you say and the decision to act upon those things will all influence the outcome of what happens to you - you might live happily ever after, or you might die horribly, depending on who you ask.

And when we talk about freedom of speech, aren't we talking about the freedom to speak freely and without fear of consequences from society? So why does it seem like our language has become something different? Why is it that when we call for change in society, we're not calling for us to change ourselves, but rather for others to change themselves? The problem is that even though these things may sound similar to us, they are fundamentally very different. There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to say what we want, but it needs to come with responsibility. You cannot just shout at a crowd to cause a riot, but you need to be prepared to act accordingly.\n\n&gt;And isn't the important part that these are all *speech*?\n\nYes.

Also, it depends on how much water is used, so some machines can wash dishes without any water.  And even those that do use water, it's usually not very effective at removing dirt and grime.  \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if you're talking about the \"dirtiness\" of the dishes, or their surface finish.  If they're pretty smooth, there shouldn't really be any problem with them being left undisturbed by the dishwashing cycle.

You need a tool to reach the spot where the plate touches the sides of the sink, and that's what the dishwasher does. It cleans it with water, but it also picks up any debris that gets left behind, so it doesn't make sense to let the plate sit there all day long waiting to be picked up by someone who wants to clean it.

The more awareness for what it is, the better.\n\nI have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because it's been bothering me.\n\nLittle background: I've never been clinically diagnosed (I'll get to why later), but for the first 2 years of college, something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends, to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly 50 pounds over those 2 years, and I was failing all my classes. I wasn't even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also, I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them, but it occupied my mind quite a bit. \n\nI wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time, and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it, and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasn't able to do any of that. Like I couldn't get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that, and I still do. \n\nSo here's where it gets interesting, and here's where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost 3-4 years ago so I'm forgetting exactly where the shift happened, but the summer after my 2nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head (obviously), and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations, when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isn't mean or nice, it's indifferent.

But your \"thoughts\" aren't always accurate. Your thoughts can also be wrong. If you're thinking that \"my dad is a jerk\", then you might not really believe him. Or maybe he is, but you don't feel it yourself. Or perhaps you just don't care enough to say anything. Or maybe you did, but you didn't tell anyone. Or maybe you told someone else who doesn't share your views.\n\nIt's possible for someone to be completely right but at the same time completely wrong. So if you have some doubt about how much you understand your own feelings, then you need to check your beliefs. Just because you think \"my dad is a jerk\" does not mean that he is.\n\nThe reason I think you need to look at things objectively is because sometimes you'll find yourself saying things like \"you guys are stupid\" or \"that's silly\" without realising that you're expressing an opinion based on a belief that you haven't really fully checked.

I was struggling to understand why I was being depressed. I didn't want to just give up and take suicide. I was just confused as to why I was doing this to myself. I decided to try and see what was causing this feeling of depression, and then I found out that it was a combination of stress and anxiety. I also felt like I was losing touch with reality and people around me. I was starting to feel like I wasn't worthy of love, and I felt like I wasn't good enough. I was always looking back at things negatively, and it made me feel bad for myself. When I finally took it easier, I realized that I was suffering from depression, and that it was something that I could treat.

This view allows us to be content with our flaws and gives us the cue that we can't achieve those goals that others have achieved when. I honestly believe that if I stop comparing myself to people, I will lose the edge in my career path (music) and will not be viewed as serious.  \n Ultimately, people who do not compare themselves are not being realistic and are hiding from reality.

We live in an era of abundance where countries as small as Estonia are capable of producing the food supply for the entire planet. There is no constraint when it comes to basic necessities such as food, clothing or shelter. \nThis is very different from the pre-world war II era when the world still did not have the technical prowess to meet the demands of the world. It is different from the world where Gallbraid hypothesized that population growth will exceed the rate at which we increasing output. He was wrong. \nToday, the rich and poor don't fight for the same goods and services. Even though there is disparity between how much rich and poor earn, there is no pressure from the rich hogging resources such as food. If anything, the rich spend their income on lavish items such as yatches, cars and many other material items which although valuable are not necessary for survival. \nSo what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the have-nots jealous of the have's? I understand their are ethical issues with it, but what I'm more concerned with is, how income inequality can be bad for society, the economy or our general well being? \n\n[Response to your replies]: A lot of you have pointed out that income equality leads to higher child mortality rates, health, etc. Although some of it is convincing, there is not enough evidence to support causation. \nOthers have pointed out that income equality is cause of poverty. This assumption is based on the fact that we have limited resources and when equality rises, the rich hog more resources while poor are left with none. Again, I must urge that there is lack of evidence in this theory as well. The economic pie has been growing and the rich has been simply getting a bigger slice, and there is a legitimate reason for it. Since the wave of globalization started, the wealthy got even wealthier because they had seen their markets grow far bigger than ever before.

That doesn't make anyone happy, and that is why it creates resentment. When you compare the prices for various commodities, you see that prices go up when you increase quantity. The people who own these commodities are the ones who benefit most, so they are more likely to demand high prices. The richer the country, the more they want to pay for things. This is one of the main reasons why we need to control inflation. \n\n&gt; So what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the have-nots jealous of the have's?\n\nI guess the answer is that if you look at the average of all the people in the world, you get a very large amount of money.

It is very hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that women can be so selfish to give up a life, when there are families out there trying so hard to have children, but can’t. In our society today, the amount of people looking to adopt is so large that almost any person who doesn't want to keep their child can find a suitable home for him/her. Growing up in a conservative, catholic, family has definitely altered my view about abortion, and going to catholic school has pushed it even farther. Abortion is against the catholic religion, and there are many different family planning options that anyone can use. I have learned for years that abortions can cause severe emotional trauma, and many people regret it afterwards, so why should it be allowed in the first place. I have also heard many times that it is the women’s body and she should decide what to do with it. Yes, I do believe that to be true in some sense, but once you have another life inside of you, it isn't just your body, its their body too. Abortion was illegal in the United States for some time, but eventually was ruled constitutional by some means. With all of that being said, I do agree that there needs to be better sources of education for troubled women who don’t have anyone to turn to for guidance. I also know the dangers if the woman’s life is at risk, but in modern society there are many different approaches that can deal with these situations. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When someone asks \"what does a pregnant woman do?\", we're asking them what they do in order to become a mother, but then we ask again if they did something else prior to becoming pregnant. So yes, a fetus actually existed during the time of conception. But since it's an embryo (and thus unborn), it already existed before conception. \n\nThis makes it difficult to say how long the pregnancy goes on, as a fetus would still exist until birth. There's no way of telling, and that's fine. A pregnant woman could conceive and die while waiting for her baby to come into this world, but that doesn't mean that she hasn't been pregnant yet.
