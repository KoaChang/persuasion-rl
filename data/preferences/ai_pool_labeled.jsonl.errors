At the risk of sounding like an anarchist, it would seem that more strict laws directly create more crime. [Prohibition, for example](http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-157.html) directly increased the consumption of alcohol and tons of violence associated with the new lawlessness of the industry. I know this is a tired argument for the legalization of marijuana, but imagine how much *less crime* we would have if a common substance was decriminalized.\n\nImagine a hypothetical situation where the consumption of meat is made illegal. There would be mass uproar, of course, and people would still want to eat meat illegally. Most of us would become criminals over night. Think of the magnitude of the illegal meat industry.. entire states would be controlled by meat-gangs and we would have armies of cattle farming rebels all across the countryside. Murder, assault, theft, and every other universal-ish offense would skyrocket. \n\nSo at one extreme, we have a very strict and nosy (1984-esque) government that results in tons of crime and undesirable behaviors. What's at the other extreme? What if **murder was legal**!? This is extreme and I'll probably get stoned for saying that^420blazeit but just stop and think about it for a second. \n\nThink about the American Frontier in the early 1800s. Everyone packed heat, everyone was a potential murder victim or murderer. The law was there but they were on the same level as the lawless. Everyone was equal in the eyes of Smith &amp; Wesson.

There are laws regarding crimes, but these laws don't apply to what happens when you break them, or who gets arrested and punished for breaking them. It's almost like a game of \"chess\" where everyone plays their hand first before deciding on rules. In the real world, there aren't any rules because there isn't any game being played. People play chess for fun, and sometimes for money. There aren't rules to decide if you win or lose, so there's no way to determine fairness or justice.\n\nWhen people break the laws, they often go home, and then others come after them. For example, if someone breaks traffic laws while driving, other drivers might stop them and take out a ticket, but the person doesn't even notice until they're caught by police. They might walk away and then another driver comes along and pulls them over. They could be fined, or taken into custody, or both.

In fact, the state has had a decriminalization initiative called \"Treaties on Cannabis\" since 1986. They're not perfect though - some people don't take it seriously, and there are still problems with drug possession laws. However, when I talk to the folks who work for the Department of Public Safety, they tell me that their goal is to keep drug users off drugs so they won't commit serious crimes. When they talk to the local police department, they say that they want the public to feel safe driving in the city because it's safer to drive than in the country because it's harder to break into buildings and homes.\n\nThere's a lot of good research out there regarding marijuana and its impact on society.

Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.).

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Apologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do anything to help my confusion. Viscerally, I feel like the two **are** different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent.\n\nThe primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011) that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/795.full.pdf&amp;), then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences 'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding.\n\nAnother argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt;I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing.\n\nThere's nothing monolithic about \"black\" identity. There's a lot of variation among black people, and it makes sense that people would have different ideas of what constitutes \"blackness.\" But you're still making the assumption that any given black person will have some kind of black identity. That may be true, but we know very little about what it means to be black, so we can't make any reasonable claim about how many blacks would actually identify themselves as black. \n\n&gt;But you're still making the assumption that any given black person will have some kind of black identity.\n\nIt's not an assumption, it's an observation. The vast majority of African-Americans don't believe in Black Lives Matter (they don't even believe in the existence of a god). Some who do, however, see their community as being overwhelmingly Black. This could mean that while they might be proud of their racial identity, it's something else entirely. They're not necessarily identifying with Blackness per se, but rather with a feeling of belonging to a particular community where Blackness is a defining element. And this definition is shaped by the experiences of individuals within that community. These individuals", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not saying we shouldn't try to find evidence for gender differences - just that we shouldn't assume that they exist\n\nThat's exactly what I'm saying. The vast majority of neuroscientists and behavioral scientists agree that the sex difference in certain aspects of human behavior exists - and that their research shows it exists. The problem is that they don't know *how* it does so. In fact, they can't even say how many ways there are. We know the brain uses different parts differently to perform different functions, but we can't tell how those functions relate to each other. \n\nThere are lots of hypotheses about the nature of the relationship between gender and brain structure and function, but none of them have been tested yet. There's no way to know which one of them is right without testing them. And even if we did test them, it would still leave us with more questions than answers. \n\nIn short: I think the issue isn't that there are biologically different ways of being female and male. It's that we don't have a way to measure which part of the brain is used for which task, and we don't have any way to understand how the brain works.

Good CGI takes expertise and time and a ton of money, and a lot of film companies are getting very lazy and using CGI where it's unneeded. For example, the CGI in the original Lord of the Rings trilogy was absolutely ground-breaking and amazing, and yet the new ones looked like much less time and care went into it and ended up ruining a lot of the aesthetics.

So if it works great for one scene, it won't necessarily work great for another scene. It also depends on the quality of the actors, the camera angles, the lighting, etc\n\nThat makes sense. But it still seems like there's no way to justify spending that much money on creating CGI that isn't actually useful. Maybe someone could explain how that's not true? \n\nAlso, I'm really curious about the idea behind the \"new\" Hulk. How did you get the idea to make him look different? Is it because you're a fan of that style of visual effect, or maybe he was a good choice for the movie?\n\nAnd then I think you said that you felt like it wasn't necessary. That's exactly the problem, because CGI is expensive, so we shouldn't be making it unnecessarily.

I don't see how the CGI does anything that isn't already available, so if someone wants to add a little CGI to their story, then they need to find another way to get the same result. For example, let's say that you want to take a picture of a dog chasing a ball. That's a good enough reason to include CGI. \n\nBut if you're going to use the CGI, then you should use it properly, otherwise it will become distracting instead of helping the picture come across. It could be that the camera angles are too high, or the lighting is poor, or there aren't any shadows. \n\nIn short, I think the issue with CGI is that we're always making it better because it makes us look cool and awesome, but this is a problem that needs to be fixed. I don't think the only thing that needs fixing right now is the cost of producing CGI.

These kinds of statements are also often directed mainly towards girls/women. Proponents of this will say that when a young girl sees a supermodel, actress, etc., then she thinks she has to look like that, while a boy will see it and expects that all girls should look that way.\n\n\nI find this logic to be on a slippery slope and unrealistic. I don't think the media presents a bad example at all, they just present the pinnacle of beauty if you will. For example, when I am walking by a Victoria's Secret store and see a huge picure of Candice Swanepoel, I don't imagine or expect all women to look like that. Instead, I take on a more realistic approach and form the opinion that she is one of the most attractive people on the planet. On the flip side, I don't go watch Ocean's 11 and feel bad at the end because I don't look like George Clooney or Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nThink of how ridiculous this kind of logic is when you extend it to other things. Would I expect every painter to be on par with Michelangelo, every singer to have a voice like Adele, every pianist to be play like Mozart? Of course not.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: I'm going to start this by saying two things:\nI am white.\nI don't feel comfortable saying \"nigger\" or \"nigga\" outside of the context of referring to the words themselves, reading quotes, or reciting song lyrics.\n\nI'm prefacing this with that just so that concerns about trying to justify saying it when I know I shouldn't can be bypassed completely. I'd like to feel comfortable saying any word I don't mean hatefully without my intentions being doubted, but my purpose here is to have the view that there *ought* to be nothing wrong with me saying it challenged. ***Ninja Edit*** \n\nI was raised in a not particularly diverse part of America and a decent chunk of my school career was spent in classes or watching presentations or badly acted videos about how judging people based on their skin color was wrong and that labeling people based on their skin color was wrong etc. I and my white classmates and my white teachers were all pretty much on the same page about the \"n-word\" being bad and mean. \n\nNow as I'm getting older and finding myself really enjoying hip hop in general, I'm discovering that a (to me) surprising portion of the population seems to think they've taken the word back and made it their own. Which would be great if it were true because then a group of people would have been able to take a label of disempowerment, and remove the hate from it; appropriate it into something positive and wear it as a badge of honor and solidarity. And if you glanced at hip hop music out of context, you might even think they succeeded.\n\nIn that context it draws similarities to the word \"nerd\" and \"geek\" where the people labeled that way decided that what made them that way was something to be proud of, not ashamed. Obviously when you're talking about hobbies vs. race it's not a perfect example and I'm by no means trying to trivialize the oppression that did happen. I'm no stranger to the historical context of the word and why any time it comes out of a white person's mouth, it seems justifiable to be susp\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "response_1": "&gt; I'm not sure what makes some people feel like they deserve to use the word \"nigga,\" but I do think that if someone says \"nigga\" and I agree with them, then it makes me feel better for saying it. I feel more secure knowing that I'm not doing anything wrong. But I do feel uncomfortable saying \"nigerian.\" I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or feel guilty about it. I don't want to make anyone feel bad about it. I don't want to cause any embarrassment for myself. I don't want to be seen as a racist. I don't want to feel like I'm doing something wrong by speaking the word. I don't want to feel like I'm not okay because I didn't say it right. I feel that I need to speak out against this thing and not feel ashamed. I feel like I'm doing something wrong by not taking responsibility for it.\n\nI'm not an expert in this area, but I think it sounds like you're confusing \"black\" and \"white\". The word \"nigerian\" has to be applied to the entire population of Nigeria, not just the black population, which is why we have to specify who is a \"nigerian\".", "response_2": "&gt; But I'm not trying to trivialize the oppression that did happen.

That is certainly true, but it doesn't change your position. It does change mine though. You see, I believe that it's better to talk about racism than not. The problem with being racist is that we need to talk about it. We need to explain to each other how our actions affect others. If we don't talk about it, nobody will ever learn.\n\nIf you're black and want to be proud of it, then you have to explain it. If you're white and want to be proud of it, then you have to explain it. Why? Because if you're proud of being black, then you need to explain why. If you're proud of being white, then you need to explain why. This isn't necessarily a negative thing, but it is a fact. Your action has consequences. If you act positively towards black people, then you will face some consequences. If you act negatively towards black people, then you may", "error": "Error code: 500 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'api_error', 'message': 'Internal server error'}, 'request_id': None}"}
