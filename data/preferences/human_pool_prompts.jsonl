I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off.

I love Bill Nye, I think Ham is a fraud and a lunatic.\n\nSo why do I think he won?\n\nWell, Nye's focus was too factual. He was never incorrect that I'm aware of, and his points were good, but they weren't on-point for the topic of the debate.\n\nJust as Ham managed to not address most of the questions the moderator asked, Nye managed to not fully address the topic of the debate. \n\nLets be clear, the topic was \"Is creation a viable model of origins in today’s modern scientific era?\" To prove this, Ham merely needed to demonstrate that scientific progress can be made while still holding a creation belief. With testimony, he did that. He also illustrated that one could believe that things like evolution and physics are driven by their creator. Nye, on the other hand, never demonstrated how creation belief hinders scientific progress - how it is non-viable. Only how it is wrong and silly. I think he could have won by pointing out that Ham's statement of \"nothing will change my mind\" is the antithesis of scientific thought and is why creationism isn't viable.\n\nComment 1: Bill Nye's argument was \"Evolution is the accepted theory, here is all the evidence we have supporting it, and please if you have any actual evidence that contradicts it, such as XYZ, bring it to us and we will change our minds.\n\nKen Ham's argument was \"This book tells me what the truth is, and no amount of evidence will change my mind to the contrary.\"\n\nThe question of the night was \"Does the creationist theory hold as a viable model for where we came from?\" not \"Can a creationist become a scientist, despite being a creationist?\"\n\nThe only point that Ken Ham had to stand on (when he wasn't pointing back to \"The bible tells me it is real\") was \"We weren't around to see the rings on the trees, or the layers of ice and how they were formed, so this is all speculative\" and the rebuttal to that from Nye boiled down to \"We are extrapolating backwards using what we know to make predictions\", or put another way \"If something consistently behaves in a certain manner, the \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1x3jm2", "utterance_id": "t1_cf84ju9", "response_tokens": 58, "context_tokens": 473}}

I finished my first year of college recently and am still largely undecided on my major. I have put a lot of thought into fields of study, and am doing my best to come to a good decision. I am the type of person that most people expect to go into a mathematical/scientific field, and I am interested in the theory of both. At this point, however, I have reached the conclusion that they tend to be over-praised and see no reason to pursue a degree in the fields.\n\n**THINGS I AM NOT CLAIMING:**\n\n1. Science and math are useless\n\n2. It is universally a mistake to major in science/math (note: for the rest of my post, I only say \"science.\" Assume in all cases that I am still referring to both science and math)\n\n3. All STEM majors are poor choices\n\nWhat my position comes down to, essentially, is this: To obtain a science degree, a person must put forth years of effort--some useful, a lot drudgery--before they have any significant chance of producing something useful. For most scientific fields, a bachelor's is just the beginning, and if one intends to help with scientific advancements down the road, higher education is just short of critical. During this time, likely around eight years, a student will learn some fascinating things. However, that student will also be expected to undergo a lot of rote memorization, unnecessary classes, and busywork. During this time, the student is under significant pressure to maintain grades and stay at the top of everything, because (at least in the United States, and likely elsewhere) higher-level opportunities are limited. \n\nFinally, after those years of effort and study, the real work begins: advancing science. This is what most people who enter these fields want to do, to the best of my understanding. Even then, though, it is impossible to escape the drudgery. Science is a long, slow, often unpleasant process with occasional moments of excitement and success. Again, it is important to emphasize that those fascinating, wonderful moments exist.

People on the far left, the very religious, atheists, and hardcore supporters of a paticular product brand come to mind.\n\nThis can, understandably, piss many people off. This is especially true if the group or individual was minding their own business and an outsider barges in to tell them off. Normally considered a very rude thing to do.\n\nNow the people that do this do it because they think they are doing good for the world, and I can understand that. What is \"moral\" is a very subjective thing though; it is a human creation in the minds of the people. The universe is cold and indifferent to human action. The person who you are yelling at doesn't see themselves as \"the bad guy\".\n\nGiven this, the people that engage in such behavior should stop acting victimized when their target yells at them, tells them to fuck off, or threatens them instead of listening. I have no sympathy for someone who barges into another's personal space and starts making trouble for them. In my mind, they are reaping what they sowed. CMV\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     \n\nAnother logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are \"chubby-chasers\" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. \n\n\nEdit: To clarify, the use of the words \"slut\" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit.

I don't have any scientific knowledge, in fact I don't think there can even be any scientific knowledge that can imply a reasoning such as this. It seems to me to be an idea that could be true and also may not be true.\n\nFurther, who am I to judge that someone else's life with someone else's perspective that it is always wrong to kill oneself?

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\nComment 1: You're saying that since the brain filters and processes sensory information, it is equally as \"in contact\" with reality as a brain on drugs? That is a [false equivalence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence).\n\nHave you ever been under the effects of those drugs? If so, how could you claim with a straight face that your grip on reality while sober is not significantly better than while on hallucinogens?\n\nA long, long time ago, I used to do mushrooms.

Bookmarks are very useful because they let me get back to where I paused very quickly, without the bother of trying to recall what page number I was on from memory. They come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes, some are colourful, they may have nice messages on them - I think book lovers are aware of the little aesthetic pleasure of bookmarks. \n\nSo why do some people not use them? I don't understand it at all. I pick up free bookmarks from the local library (they have the opening hours printed on them - yay!), and I've also used a strip of paper to use as a bookmark when I've needed to. And if I use a strip of white paper as a bookmark I sometimes use it to scribble notes about the book, though if I own the book I'm fine with scribbling in the margins as well. In fact, there was a book I read that required using 3 bookmarks to read efficiently and I loved it all the more for it.\n\nSo please help me understand the other side. This is a lighthearted topic, and I'm really looking to see whether people make a conscious choice to not use bookmarks. If it is, why? \n\nEdit: All right, I've had my view changed. Those who don't use bookmarks have found methods of *getting by* without using them. Though there are no arguments against the aesthetic appeal of having a colourful bookmark, there are certain cases where just having one could lead to a bit of trouble.

However, as a conservative I would love to have my view changed on welfare. I believe we need welfare. And not because the rich ruling class wants to subdue poor people and keep them down. Everyone knows that lighting a fire under most people would get them to strive for more, but not all will, and many will fail to succeed. I believe some will commit suicide, turn to prostitution, rob, steal, riot, etc. \n\n\n**Economy:**\nAssuming every former welfare recipient finds employment, the job market would become oversaturate. This “get a job, you slacker!” mentality is simply unrealistic. Special programs and regulations would have to be in place to hire a certain percentage of unskilled worker instead of qualified workers. I have heard the current state of welfare compared to slavery, but welfare is free money to the recipient; slavery more equates to working for minimum wage with no feasible escapement. Even with minimum wage, there is a chance (possibly small) that one can work their way up or transition to a better job. As a right-leaning individual I think capitalism is a good thing. It is far from perfect, but I believe it gives many people a chance. Welfare doesn't really give anything but sustenance. Welfare can be viewed as a result of capitalism. Not everyone wants to or is able to play the capitalist’s game. They currently get our scraps. The problem is: we are getting stingy with our scraps.\n\n\n**The new Laws:**\nNow, laws have been passed requiring welfare recipients to pass drug tests to continue receiving aid. I think this is a bad idea for many reasons, including costs. However, the primary reason for me to not want to sneakily dismantle welfare is because the aid is intended to help children. No one gives a shit about the parents, and for good reason, fuck ‘em. We are trying a trickle down approach to feeding children and single mothers. \n\n\n\nIf welfare were to be rapidly dismantled, I believe the US would be in a worse state.

Reddit posts seem to use the banana as a method of portraying scale and it seems to me that this is a poor way of doing so, for the following reasons:\n\n1) a bannana is not a uniform size. There are large bananas and small bananas\n\n2) The curve. Bananas are not usually straight. This makes judging their length difficult. It can also mean that it is hard to show the banana very close to the object you are scaling against.\n\n3) Bananas are relatively small, this makes them bad for judging the scale of larger objects. This is especially bad when considered in conjunction with point 1, as any difference between the percieved size of a banana and the actual size will be enhanced for an object many times the size of the banana. \n\n4) Bananas are perishable. This means that it is unreasonable to expect a redditor to have them on hand at all times. I for one do not at present own a banana as being a poor student living alone I cannon afford a fully equiped fruit collection, I only own at most 2 types at a time (at present I own apples and pears). \n\n5) Bananas are relatively large. This may conflict with point 3, but the point is that when scaling small objects (pins, hair ect) then a banana is too large, meaning that in order to use one for scale you would either need to show only a small amount of the banana (therefore making it fairly useless for judging scale) or you would need to 'zoom out' in order to show the entire banana thus making the object less visible and therefore harder to judge scale. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, when it comes to debate, I struggle finding a reason people *need* an AR15. \n\n**Argument**\n\nThe standard, but weak, argument I currently give in favor of an AR15 is, *everybody is different and needs to find the gun that's right for them; different sized hands, arm length, number of arms (less than two), and ability shoot accurately all play a role in weapon selection, and there is no one gun that fits everyone. So if some shoot better with an AR15, that’s the gun they should own.*\n\nThat's my standard argument, but there's a part of me that still nags the question, \"if anyone can train to use any weapon, why is the AR15 needed?\"\n\n**AR15**\n\nMy exposure to the AR15 community extends beyond just what I hear about on TV. I know quite a few people that have one and have shot a few variants of them. Here's what I think of them, personally.\n\nWhat I think of the AR15 is, it's a bunch of expensive accessories attached to a gun. The accessories go with a theme or purpose of what role the AR15 is suppose to fill. If I go to the range and show any interest in someone's AR, they'll ask me if I want to try it, then point to all of the little assessors they bought for it. What the AR guys do is, they buy their AR then dump money into parts, which they add throughout the year. It's like Lego's, except each “brick” runs about $80 to $1000 and they're pretty much all black. The gun seems infinity useful, but ultimately become a range toy or used for competition. \n\n**Home defense**\n\nNow, home defense, might be the number one reason people get an AR, but I will always say the best gun for home defense will be anything chambered in 12 gauge.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: **THE NAME YOUR PRICE SCHEME**  \n\nSo this idea would radically restructure employment as we know it today. In simplest terms, here's how it would work:  \n\n1. Every two years, you cast a vote by writing in the wage you would like to receive for the next two years. The figure you write in becomes your *actual* salary, unless your write-in is below the minimum wage (see below). You effectively name your price for two years (assuming you can find an employer willing to pay you that price).  \n\n2. The national average of all the votes becomes the new legal minimum wage. This is the salary you'll receive if you a) enter the labor market without having voted previously, or b) voted yourself a salary below the minimum wage, in which case your salary would be raised to the legal minimum.  \n\n3. Unemployment insurance (and social security benefits/pensions) will be expanded to cover the unemployment, if any, caused by higher labor costs. For the first 6 months, unemployment will pay the full minimum wage. Every 6 month period after that, unemployment benefits will be reduced by 6.25%, steadily increasing the incentive to find work. You can volunteer at any time to forego your elected salary and accept the minimum wage, if that helps you find work. Excess unemployment insurance will be financed by a surtax on high-bracket incomes, capital gains and corporate taxes.  \n\n4. GDP adjustment. All salaries – regular, minimum wage, unemployment &amp; pension benefits – are subject to GDP adjustment. If the sum total of write-in salaries turns out to be larger than total annual GDP, reductions would have to be made. Similarly, if total salaries are far lower than GDP, they would be adjusted upwards. The exact adjustment would need some fine-tuning... salaries obviously can't be 100% of GDP, but I'm not sure what their ideal or natural ratio to GDP should be. Or maybe GDP adjustment is a bad idea. This part is complicated and a little above my pay grade.  \n\n5. Inflation adjustment. All salaries would be indexed to inflation, incremented (or lowered) annually.  \n\n**DISCUSSION**  \n\nHere's why I thi\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_20fig7", "utterance_id": "t1_cg2td96", "response_tokens": 193, "context_tokens": 464}}

While my view did not undergo a radical change, I have a new persective on this topic. While I still believe that it is MY right to decide when to die, I have realized that this view I hold is most likely due to my mental illness (depression and BPD). Therefore, I can't fully claim that my view is 100% correct, due to the fact that mental illness tends to cloud rational thinking. Thank you again for all of your responses. \n\nI  have been thinking about this for a while, and I'm completely dead set on my opinion. My opinion is that if you are an adult, you should have the right to decide when/how you will die, and my opinion extends to suicide. However, my opinion is causing me pain, and I am 100% open on having my view changed. Unfortunately, I just haven't heard good enough arguments that have changed my view. Before I go any further, I just want to thank anyone who will contribute to this.\n\nI am a 22 year old female who recently attempted suicide in December of 2014. For all of 2014, I was depressed. I am not talking about feeling \"sad\" or \"having the blues\". I am talking about depression that physically hurts. The worst part about it is that my depression often times came on for NO reason (I could be having fun and then all of a sudden, my depression hits). Unfortunately, I was brought to the ER after my attempt. If I wasn't found, I would have died. Since my attempt, I have been dealing with a lot more depression. This is my final attempt to try to change my view about \"the right to die\". Below are my reasons why I hold this view.\n\n* In society, we get to chose a lot of things. Especially in Western cultures that value individuality, many (even most) get to chose if they will go to college, if they will marry, if they will have kids, etc. However, suicide is not considered one of our rights.

Her response suggests that there's nothing atypical about being genderqueer when there obviously is.  There's nothing wrong with being genderqueer, just like there's nothing wrong with having red hair or being an astronaut, but it is atypical; someone may be surprised to learn this about another person.\n\nTo me, this just seems like a reason to put typical people on the defensive when they broach the topic of gender studies.\n\nChange my view.\n\nEdit #1:\nAt this point, I'm just deciding who to give a delta to.  A medical journal headline reading \"New results from a study on Japanese nonheternormative behavior,\" clearly couldn't use the word typical in the same way.  You could work around it with something like \"behavior atypical for sex and gender majority,\" but that's a mouthful if you work in that field.\n\nI still have the following problems with it:\n\n     The word is overused, especially in contexts where it's already established that you're talking about a nonheteronormative class.  Since this is basically all contexts where it's relevant, and represents all contexts where I've ever actually heard it used, you can understand my predelta opinion.\n\n     The word seems to convey an attitude that LGBT persons have any reason to be offended when people call them unusual.\n\n     The word requires, in most cases, about the same amount of context as atypical.\n\nEdit #2: the delta post is very hard to find because of,  I suspect,  the downvoting of parent posts.

As such, I tend to favor \"conservative\" candidates (in Northern California, the \"right\" is still pretty damn far left), but our region and state is strongly blue.

My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average - the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nI suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. As the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment. This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place.\n\nStill, despite this - I can't help but get pissed when liberals rag on the native working class as \"Rednecks\" or \"Bogans\" (Or for black people trying to get ahead, \"Uncle Toms\") that supposedly vote against their own best interest by voting to halt immigration. This might be the only form of protectionism I can genuinely sympathize with. Please change my view - I'm open to your ideas.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I love the shows Battlestar Galactica and Game of Thrones. I enjoy philosophy, comics and read a fair amount of fantasy books. When I was younger, like many young people I went through periods where I felt like a social pariah.\n\nThere are also other ways that I am nerdy that most people wouldn't consider the norm - I love elimination based competitive reality TV shows (such as Survivor or Big Brother). I watch the shows analytically and I'm fascinated by watching the human psychology that people display when they are on them. I can tell you an insane amount of information about these two shows. \n\nFor these reasons I think it's a fair assertion to say that I am a nerd. It's neither a badge of honour for me, or something I am ashamed of. It's just a fact.\n\nBut I am also someone who has tried hard to learn social skills, invests time into maintaining fulfilling relationships with friends and family, and I try to maintain my physical appearance. Also, despite being an introvert I try to do something social at least once or twice a week. I hate metal and like a lot of popular music I hear on the radio. I'm not remotely interested in anime.

While three or four dollars is not much money on its own, the entertainment value of the product, in my experience, not worth the amount I pay. I'll use an example.\n\nRecently, I bought the first issue of the new Ms. Marvel series at $2.99. In it, there were 20 pages of story and it took me about 10-15 minutes maybe to read through the whole book. There were about four scenes in the book (the store, the house, the party, and Kamala gaining her powers), all of which served to introduce Kamala, but little else. While the narrative was entertaining, it stopped the moment it began to develop, leaving a hook for the reader to dish out an additional three dollars to further the story.\n\nConversely, a film ticket may cost about three times as much  (about seven-ten dollars depending on where and when you buy the ticket), but for that price you're getting at least an hour and a half of entertainment with a full three act story. [A book can cost between five to twenty dollars, but for that price you're getting at least several hours worth of entertainment.](http://www.slj.com/2013/06/research/sljs-average-book-prices-2013/#_). I've read other comics and I can usually finish an issue in about 10 minutes.

Good students tend to be smart, hard-working, and conformist - three crucial traits for almost any job.  When a student excels in school, then, employers correctly infer that he's likely to be a good worker.  What precisely did he study?  What did he learn how to do?  Mere details.  As long as you were a good student, employers surmise that you'll quickly learn what you need to know on the job.\n\n\nObviously this applies to some fields more than others.  Med school is not just signaling.  But for most degrees, especially outside of hard science, I think the signaling model is persuasive.\n\n**EDIT 1**\n\nEdit to clarify based on a question below.  The view is not that signaling is a majority factor in all degrees, but that for the majority of college students, the majority of the value of the degree is the signal it sends, not specific things they learn in class.\n\nWould also be really interested in responses to [this stat](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) that only 27% of college graduates have jobs related to their major.\n\nThanks for all the replies so far by the way, has been very interesting and civil.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  \n\n&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  \n4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  \n5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  \n10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, \"driver\" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  \n15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   \n  \nBy the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.

I'm wholly indifferent to the Assassin's Creed games, but apparently this game features 4 person local multiplayer and only includes a slate of male characters. As a result of this news, some of my feminist former-friends posted articles to this effect: http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5799386/no-female-characters-in-assassins-creed-unity-too-much-work\n\nI'm not going to weigh in on the truth of Ubisoft's claims particularly, whether or not their claims were justified, or whether any of the views held by either side is right and just. The general consensus among the feminism crowd seemed to be along the lines that:\n\n* 1. There are many sexist stereotypes prevalent in video games, possibly moreso in mainstream titles, and particularly noticed (by the feminists) are those stereotypes concerning women.\n* 2. There is a large and substantial base of female gamers, many of whom would presumably enjoy games that break stereotypes and employ strong female lead characters\n* 3. Many popular games today don't necessarily serve female gamers so well\n\nI'm not going to suggest that feminists shouldn't complain (well, I might a little), but from my vantage point that's pretty much all I see get done.

I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these.  I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it.  It allows them to be a \"victim\".  I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond.  Aside from that, cyberbullying is even more BS.  Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a \"nice\" place.  It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel. At that point, it is literally JUST WORDS on a screen.  You can delete posts, block phone numbers, delete accounts...so many more ways to just \"walk away\".  Which is exactly what I and many others did when bullied in person.  \n\nEdit:  Great discussion everyone!  Thanks for all your input!\n\nComment 1: I don't know your age, but there is one thing that you may not have considered: Things aren't the same as they were when you were growing up. You say that we shouldn't be babying these kids who are victims of bullying. Did you feel that way when you were being picked on? Or did you wish someone would do something to stop it? What tools did you have to respond with? What tools do you think these kids should be given so that they won't be victimized? I mean, we have laws to protect adults from harassment... Why do you feel that children deserve anything less? \n\nAs far as Cyberbullying: It is easy to run away from a bully in person (which is what you say you did). It's a lot harder to get away when those bullies can track you to your home. Can harass you at an time of day or night. Can torment you from anywhere on the planet, regardless of where you are.

I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: \n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_3j5b7g", "utterance_id": "t1_cumhf65", "response_tokens": 391, "context_tokens": 467}}

Anyway, spoilers ahead.\n\nIt has been a while since reading 1984, but I saw someone post a thread where everyone was talking about how the book had a really depressing ending, but when I finished reading it I felt kind of happy.\n\nThroughout the whole book we feel sorry for Winston's circumstances, that he has to live under complete domination by The Party and he understands that they are changing history and suppressing his individuality. He seems constantly depressed, when he first sees Julia he is paranoid she is part of the thought police and he says he hates her, when really he has no reason to.\n\nIn the end he learns to love Big Brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss. After the struggle of the whole book it is nice that the protagonist we have grown attached to has eventually found peace and is no longer scared.\n\nI understand why some people find it depressing, as The Party aren't overthrown and the totalitarians that oppress the people win. But it was foolish to think that Winston could have really changed the situation, and in his circumstance it is surely better to follow The Party and be happy than struggle towards an unreachable goal and be depressed.\n\nIgnorance is strength CMV.\n\nEdit: I'm surprised and happy with the amount of discussion this has brought about.

Fuck everyone who thinks they're making a point with it. There is no logic in it - it's used to demean the subject, insult intelligence, and attempt to guilt the 'offending' party. It's myopic, callous, and condescending.\n\nNo one should feel guilty for being themselves. Ever. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being part of the majority, well that's life. I shouldn't have to explain that the majority of people are in a majority, that seems redundant - but these 'arguments' are always phrased as if that isn't the case. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being a minority, that's also life. \n\nThe arguments assume that the subject is incapable of empathy, and is actively attempting to hold to these 'privileges' and keep them away from everyone else. That's simply not the case. Yes, white men can walk safely down the streets in the suburbs, black men don't need to lock their doors when they roll through the ghetto, women aren't seen as creepy when they ask someone out - *good*, why is this a bad thing? In an ideal world, everyone would feel safe walking or driving in any part of town at any time, and no one would be treated as a creeper for expressing interest in another, and so forth. This isn't an ideal world - that may suck when situations where we don't have such 'privilege' are encountered, but that's life. \n\nWorse, these arguments require, by necessity, the outlook of a societal parasite. Rather than working to change things or make their own situation better, these people want to shame others for what they themselves don't have. As if screeching shrilly at someone that they should feel bad for being who they are, is somehow a morally superior stance.\n\n**edit:** View changed.

Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture.

As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line.

The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.\n&gt;\nThe current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle.

Men's chests aren't deemed to be sexual areas, that's why you guys can walk around with your tops off everywhere and it not be 'obscene' or 'public nudity' whereas women walking around with no clothes on top would be. You make the point below that it's your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent. So I can tap your shoulder from behind to get your attention, I can probably touch your elbow while flirting, I can't really grab your junk without enthusiastic consent. If your lines are different from society's that's something you have to deal with, not society. The west has deemed men's chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can't expect people to act like your chest is different. \n\n2. The situation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this - but in general women tend to touch men when they are flirting, whereas there's a pretty strong trend for men to just grab at women. There has not been a single club night in which me and my friends have not been grabbed, and often we can't even work out who did it. Ditto with whenever I've been/known a waitress.

Conflict can occur from affronted dignity, to what benefit? Dignity is used by the wealthy to emphasize class distinction and fear of violating it encourages conformity.\n\nThe benefits are all to the individual, who gets to assert high social status at the expense of society. Therefore it should be seen as a bad thing, and childlike wonder and enthusiasm should be promoted at all stages of life.\n\nComment 1: You're confusing the act with the judgement. Whether or not something is 'dignified' is a value judgement about some act a person is committing, specifically, whether or not that person is worthy of respect for committing that act. What you're really saying here is not that 'dignity' is toxic, but what we consider 'dignified' is toxic, which is to say sometimes our social norms are toxic (which is true).\n\nHowever, dignity can still be a useful concept. If someone does something worthy of respect we can encourage that behavior by calling it dignified. On the other hand, if someone does something bad but not technically *morally wrong*, we might be able to discourage that behavior by calling it undignified. Using the concept of dignity properly is all about properly identifying what should and should not be considered acts worthy of respect. I think you're right about how the concept of dignity is misused, but it's only misused when acts or persons are improperly thought of to be worthy of respect.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1ln8b5", "utterance_id": "t1_cc15r2r", "response_tokens": 128, "context_tokens": 319}}

Others that sing what someone else wrote should not be considered artists because their material is not created by them. (In the same vein, I wouldn't consider cover bands to be artists either.  But they are musicians, since they are playing instruments instead of building beats on a computer. But back to singers...). Their music is created by someone else *for* them, which they then record and take most of the credit for.  \n\nThus, singers are just *performing* a song, even if they don't ever do any live shows. They are performing the song in the studio when they record it. I get that some singers are truly talented, but I find it difficult to call them artists if someone else had the inspiration to write the material that they are simply converting to a format (music) that many people enjoy listening to. \n\nI've always been a little absentminded about radio music, since I mostly listen to progressive rock and metal, but when I discovered that many songs you hear on the radio aren't even written by the people that are performing them, I was astounded.\n\nComment 1: Part of the artistry of music **is** performance. Would you also call a singer that has no stage presence, no dance moves, and is generally visually unattractive an artist and a musician, even if they clearly could not perform given those premises? I think even performing a cover and doing so with great vocal ability and amazingly captivating performance captures the spirit of artistry and musicianship... especially considering how many bands have 1 member who writes while the rest only *perform*.\n\nComment 2: But the other band members will write their own parts to accompany what the main writer is writing, correct? Surely the main writer will have a general idea of what it should sound like, but each musician will add another layer to the sound. \n\nAnd yes, a musician/singer is still a musician/singer even if they are not *good* at live performances. The primary purpose of music (what I believe anyway) is to be listened to. Dance moves, physical appearance, stage antics are not necessary to be a good musician/singer.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1jht9q", "utterance_id": "t1_cbetqia", "response_tokens": 174, "context_tokens": 463}}

I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole, the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.\n\nAdmittedly, I have had a pro-Imperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind (especially so) and Oblivion, the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be, and so I've always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.\n\nBut now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I'm even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.\n\n**1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**\n\nThis should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.) In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.\n\nOf course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don't forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I'm sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.\n\nThere is also the matter of trade and mutu\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2cflx0", "utterance_id": "t1_cjfajp7", "response_tokens": 555, "context_tokens": 452}}

Militaries are made for fighting, whether that is defensively or offensively. Combat has some serious physical hurdles which cannot be overcome. A female soldier wearing full body armor has be able to carry one of her wounded comrades (also in body armor) out of hostile fire. Even with some of the most exceptionally tough women, this is rarely possible. Women are physically unsuited for frontline combat and the typical duties of soldiering in a hostile environment. If you would like, I can show you the accomodations in our physical conditioning programs we have had to make for them.\n\nLastly, your suggestion would put draftees at a nearly 50/50 male:female ratio. You do not have enough support jobs in your military to take up this massive glut of women. You will have to put them in the infantry and decide that either (1) you should lower any standards or (2) the standards should be ignored.\n\nIf you want to draft women into national service, you ought to draft them to do something other than the military. If they opt for the military route instead, then so be it.\n\nComment 2: I understand that the military (especially frontline) is physically very demanding and many women won't be able to perform at the necessary levels.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: This is a quandary of logic that I discovered a while back. Put simply the idea is put forward that any religion that calls for the sharing with and converting of others not in your religion means that your deity unfairly punishes certain people. While this is primarily targeted at Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, it can apply to any religion where humans are judged and then receive an eternal reward/punishment. When you have a religion that calls for a “spreading of the gospel”, to use the Christian term, you have a deity that has whether or not you're a member of his church in his list of qualifications for getting your eternal reward. Most religions explain that it is necessary (or even mandatory) for receiving the reward. \n\nThis is when I would ask what about people that never knew your religion? My usual example is people that lived in either Ancient Egypt, Greece, or other prehistoric societies, or native populations that live far remote from your church. Most explain these as either “They get a free pass” or “They never knew *My Deity*, so they receive eternal punishment.” \n\nThis leads me to say this: Either you have a deity that is willing to punish whole civilizations that never got a chance to view “the truth”, or one that let's anyone in who never had to make a choice. If it's the first, why would you want to worship someone like that? If it is the latter, why tell anyone if ignorance is a free pass?\n\nTL;DR: Either you have a massively unfair deity, or one that you wouldn't want to share the religion about.

Or that, in Buddhism, you'll literally reroll until you get the facts straight. In Islam, when the second coming rolls around, everyone gets a second chance, face to face with God, to recant their sins and believe.\n\nAlso, you misunderstand religion.

Excuse the crudeness, but there is the saying \"pussy costs money, but dick is free.\"\n\n- There are 105 men for every 100 women born. In the most active and productive years of their lives, men outnumber women, thus adding to the value of being female.\n\n- Women are given a substantial amount of attention in certain communities, like Reddit and tech-related interests. Because of this, women interested in sports, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable. I cannot think of equivalent communities where men are as \"in demand\" and desirable. \n\n- There are three times as many Male-to-Female trans operations than there are Female-to-Male [questionable statistic]. I see this as women being the more desirable gender.\n\n- Women definitively represent sexually desire, even to other women. The amount of bi-sexual women strongly outnumbers the amount of bi-sexual men [anecdotal observation]. A woman's body is considered sexy and beautiful; a man's is not.\n\n- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man.

Personally, though I'm straight, I'd sooner get a sharriage if such a thing existed than a marriage, as I'm atheist.\n\nTwo situations come to mind immediately - what if a gay couple is also religious? And what if one partner in a hetero couple is religious and the other is not?\n\nThe first scenario is a bummer, but I'd have to say that the couple would need to accept that it's their own doctrine that is getting in the way of them getting married in the first place.\n\nThe second scenario is easy. The woman gets her way. Duh.\n\nAlso - This entire view only exists because of how resistant the majority (or at least the majority in power) are to legalize same sex marriage. Obviously it would be preferable to just legalize gay marriage everywhere and be done with it, but if the reason that isn't happening is that God says it's bad, then this seems like an easy workaround to me.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1pacrh", "utterance_id": "t1_cd0cttu", "response_tokens": 150, "context_tokens": 322}}

All you would do is go \"Oh, that's so sad, 200 people were killed in a plane crash in Country X\". Maybe you'd even shed a few tears to convince yourself that you're really depressed by it, but you'd just go back to your daily life as soon as the news program ends. If the incident would affect your life directly, like if one of the victims was your best friend, I can see why you would feel sympathy, but when people say things like \"OMG!!

This something being the child's poop.\n\nComment 2: well I would hope that at the age a child starts using a shower, they would know why pooping in there would not work. Even so, with one incident, you can teach your child that this is a one way thing.

In this case, society prescribes meaning to a birth precisely every 365 days post-birth. Why? Intrinsically, there is no value in this date. A day is an approximation of the length of time it takes for the Earth to rotate on its axis with respect to the sun. Had we been living on a different planet, on a different solar system, we would probably have a different length of day. Why do we assign meaning to the 24 hour period in which we were born when it occurs 365 days later? A year later, the day is completely different. The new day has no intrinsic connection to the old day, yet we prescribe value to the day in a similar manner. We also make arbitrary exceptions in the form of leap years that further illegitimize the claim of true meaning.\n\n**Sidenote:** I've gotten a considerable amount of shit for having this view.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on.

If someone walks into your office, or can see over your shoulder from across the room, an image on your screen of someone's intestines hanging out or some topless lady is something they're going to recognize and possibly get you in trouble for.\n\nA text post, on the other hand, just looks like reddit.  Unless someone stands over your shoulder long enough to actually read and comprehend what's on the screen, then it's no more eye-catching than any other text-based webpage that you might be on.\n\nIf they recognize it as reddit and don't have a problem with you being on reddit at work, the odds are low that seeing \"fuck\" on the screen is going to be what crosses the line into \"inappropriate use of company resources.\"\n\nNormally this would simply be an annoyance, but many of us use the RES NSFW filter for just this purpose, and as a result don't see a high number of text posts that got flagged as NSFW because someone asked a question that might result in someone saying \"sex.\"  \n\nSo CMV.

Each state is given two representatives, no matter what the population. The issue with this is that states like Alaska and Wyoming get the same amount of votes in the Senate as Texas and California, even though the latter two states have many times more people than the former two. \n\nI don't believe this based on party lines, and I would believe this no matter what party controlled the Senate. I think that the proportions are skewed unfairly towards the smaller states, and I think it's only right that the states with more people should get more voting power in Congress since they control a larger constituency. If this is a democracy, and majority really rules, then why even have the Senate? Change my view!\n\nComment 1: The United States is an agreement between 50 states to be one united country. Thus, all states should and do get an equal say in the federal government.\n\nThe United States is not a United Peoples of America. It is not an agreement between all 311 million residents to form one national government. Furthermore, the US is not a direct democracy. It is a representative democracy split by state lines.\n\nThe founding fathers recognized the problem that you describe. That is why we a bicameral legislature. This means we have a population based House of Representatives, where big states get more votes, and a state based Senate, where all states get an equal number of votes. \n\nWith this compromise, both big states and little states are happy. It's worked for 226 years, I don't see a reason to change it now.\n\nComment 2: The issue is what happens when different parties control each chamber of Congress.

Students from middle school to college take a vow of silence in an effort to encourage schools and classmates to address the problem of anti-LGBT behavior by illustrating the silencing effect of bullying and harassment on LGBT students and those perceived to be LGBT.\" The most recent Day of Silence was on the 17th.\n\nI participated in this event multiple times when I was in high school. People generally knew that it was meant to show support for LGBT rights, but not much beyond that. People primarily seemed to use it as a way to avoid having to answer questions in class for one day.\n\nBesides my anecdotal experience, the movement fails logically as well. People's bigoted opinions are not going to be swayed by silence. In order to change people's attitudes towards LGBT* people, everyone needs to speak out about the issue of bullying and harassment, not stay silent about it.\n\nSilence does not speak volumes in this context. People cannot be educated if you are not explaining anything to them. People who bully LGBT* kids aren't going to try to understand why everyone is being silent, and even if they do understand, they aren't going to care.\n\nComment 1: The silence itself does nothing, you're right, but peer pressure is a powerful force, especially at that age, and this is a case where it can be harnessed for some positive impact.\n\nGrowing up where I did, disapproval of homosexuality was \"normal\".  It was just expected that you thought gay people were bad, and no one reacted negatively at all if you went around saying it to anyone who would listen.  \n\nSeeing that that's not the case, that a lot of people DO support gay rights, is a powerful piece of information.  I was never religious, so I didn't get on board with the whole hating gay people thing, but that was a big shock when I got to college, realizing that it was okay to outwardly support gay rights, because *other* people supported it.\n\nSo that's what the day of silence can accomplish.

You have to examine all the various consequences, effects, and repercussions. For a law to be just, it must prevent more harm than it causes; anything but legalization of all drugs (not just decriminalization) fails that test.\n\nPossibly the most popular argument for drug prohibition is due to the social harm caused by drug addiction. Certainly drug addiction does cause social harm, but that harm pales in comparison to what is caused by imprisoning vast swaths of society. Separating families and saddling users and sellers with a permanent black mark that destroys most opportunity for gainful employment and being a productive, contributing member of society is vastly destructive. In short, \"drugs will ruin your life, so we'll punish you for using drugs by ruining your life\" just fails at logic.\n\nThen there's the argument that buying drugs funds criminals and terrorists. Well, no shit, genius. If you don't allow legitimate businesses to sell it, it's going to be the criminals. This gives rise to the black market, which is the source of the vast majority of \"drug related\" crime (only a small portion is comprised of actual intoxication-induced misbehavior). Legalization of the drug trade takes the money out of the hands of gangs and terrorists, and eliminates the black market and its associated crime; this is why mere decriminalization for users is not adequate.\n\nLet's also look at effectiveness. Essentially, there isn't any. Prohibition does not decrease usage rates, which is the primary goal. I've heard the argument that \"at least it increases street prices,\" but this is a terrible argument. Increased prices don't deter use, they just make addiction more financially devastating for addicts (thus increasing, not decreasing harm), and the increased profits just add incentive for criminals to produce/traffic/sell more - and use violence to protect their profits. In short, when you consider the total lack of effectiveness alongside all of the collateral social damage, drug prohibition doesn't actually *do* anything except harm society.\n\nAll in all, any opinion supportin\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1rqcx7", "utterance_id": "t1_cdpuw4m", "response_tokens": 334, "context_tokens": 448}}

Most of the moms I am challenging with this post are in two-adult households.\n* I am *not* saying that all moms should stay home with their children. If a mom justifies going back to work because she doesn't really enjoy staying home, great! Go back to work, and know that you are being totally honest with the world and yourself. If you have any other reason for going back to work, other than some version of \"we can't afford for me stay home,\" great! Have a great career! You are not to whom this post is addressed.\n* I know that I am being terribly gender exclusive with my language. I fully support dads that want to stay home. In reality, though, I have never met one. Every person I have heard give the \"can't afford to stay home\" line was a woman. In reality, though, my argument would be just as valid if a couple considered the dad staying home but concluded that \"we just can't afford for him to stay home.\"\n* I personally see value in a mom staying home until all the kids are in school. To me, I do not see much value for the family in her staying home after that. **BUT THIS IS TOTALLY MY OPINION AND IS IRRELEVANT TO MY ARGUMENT.** I don't really care if you think moms and/or dads should stay home or not. I only care about why they believe they are not staying home.\n\nHere is the core of my argument. **Many women convince themselves that they really want to stay home with the kids but that their current financial realities, over which they have no real control, will not allow them to do so. **Essentially, they are convincing themselves that powers outside of their control are dictating that\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2i6l9n", "utterance_id": "t1_ckzcg4f", "response_tokens": 403, "context_tokens": 451}}

I think that after examining the Bible, there is no argument that being transgender is wrong. Indeed, there are only three main prongs of attack, all of which are incorrect.\n\nThe first prong of attack is the homosexuality argument. However, if someone really is the opposite gender, then it would by definition not be homosexual.\n\nThe second prong of attack is the rule against cross dressing. However, if someone really is the opposite gender, it's not cross dressing.\n\nThe third prong of attack is against physical mutilation of the body. I think there are other things wrong with this argument. However, that someone is transgender does not imply that they will or have to 'mutilate' their body. They may be happier if they do, but being transgender does not entail it happening.\n\nNone of these imply that being transgender it's self is in any way wrong. It is always something else that commonly goes along with transgender issues that makes it wrong.\n\nEdit: This argument depends upon a non-biological definition of gender. If gender is biological, then the attacks make a lot more sense. However, this raises the question, \"Can we define gender as biological based on the Bible?\"\n\nComment 1: Before I start here, I want to say that I'm an atheist and my objective in arguing is to argue that the Bible is immoral on this point, not to say that being trans is really wrong.\n\nAt the end of Genesis 3 God curses all parties involved with eating the fruit of the forbidden tree. The curses of the snakes and men are not relevant here, but here's how he curses women:\n\n&gt;16 To the woman he said, “I will make your pains in childbearing very severe;\n    with painful labor you will give birth to children.\nYour desire will be for your husband,\n    and he will rule over you.”\n\nComment 2: ... and?\n\nComment 3: He says pretty clearly that women bear children.

Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement.\n\nThe manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points:\n\n1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking).\n\n2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components.\n\n3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. \n\nWhen we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there.\n\nIt is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency  over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. It is my contention that hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1khlm7", "utterance_id": "t1_cbp0hy4", "response_tokens": 650, "context_tokens": 397}}

Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis.

Your ability to learn and be edified, I feel, is directly hindered by self-confidence.\n\nIn my experience, I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can, and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw, but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.\n\nConsequently, I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith, and quite another to be a fanatic, but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence. It is also possible to speak with some measure of certainty about your interests and knowledge, but it is usually best, I feel, to be prepared to re-examine your perspectives on even fundamental beliefs at any moment.\n\nThese perspectives, I do not feel, have served me very well.

If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error.

I believe that crowdfunding no matter the reason is stupid. I think it is lazy and a waste of time and money on both the requesting person's part and those who donate money to whatever it is they are sending money towards. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, crowdsourcing is lazy in my opinion. Now in a capitalist society, people start a business with an idea or vision, then fund their ideas with their own personal money, though a few family members or friends may feel free/happy to give some money or help with said business idea. For example if I wanted to open a coffee shop in town, I'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though I wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. With crowdfunding, I feel like you're essentially begging for money via the internet. It's the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. I think if you have an idea and you want to make it happen, you should be get it done yourself without begging your 200 Facebook friends for money. For example, one of my friends that I've known for years decided she wanted to go find the identity of her biological parents. She was adopted as an infant and doesn't know who her biological parents are. So she started a crowdfunding campaign asking for $2,000 to cover the expenses of finding her parents through an adoption agency. If I were in her shoes, I'd never ask for other people's money, I'd pay the bill all by myself instead of asking for money from other people via Facebook.\n\nMy next point is, I think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they're giving money to.

The whole idea of boy/girl and man/woman is just a product of gender roles and stereotypes. You can't be a man (person with a penis) and \"feel\" like a woman simply because you like to shop and play with barbies and wear dresses. You can't be a woman (person with a vagina) and \"feel\" like a man just because you like sports and beer. It doesn't make sense.\n\nWhile these people deserve to be treated equally, just like anyone else, I think it's insane to get a sex change operation just because you don't conform with societies idea of a man or a woman. Yes, there may be difficulties, such as discrimination or finding a partner, but that's something that you just have to deal with. To me, it seems like the equivalent of a black man getting surgery to become white because he is discriminated against/wants to be with a white woman who does not want him because he is black. \n\nI think getting a sex change is extreme conformity, something that these people advocate against. Because they don't agree with the way society portrays their gender, they change their anatomy to match the one society says they should have. These same people preach that conformity is bad and it's okay to be different. If it's okay to be different, why do you feel the need to get a sex change? I don't hate them, I just cannot agree with or understand their ideals at all.

In a time when so many are rejecting basic science, it's good to see a TV franchise that can romanticize the actual pursuit of science. My only reservation here is that it doesn't portray a balanced view that would promote sustainability in current behavior practices, making the future look far rosier than it will actually be.\n\nThat said, some of my reservations are on the cultural side of things. Culturally, the Star Trek mantra containing \"...to seek out new life and new civilizations\" is problematic because it suggests a fairly human-centric and ethnocentric view of the universe. The underlying implication is that a civilization is new until humanity meets it. It would have been inappropriate in Columbus' era to call the First Peoples a new civilization simply because Europeans had not yet met them, so it's equally problematic for this mentality to exist in the future.\n\nThe next issue I have is about the gender typing that the show has. While series subsequent to the original series don't exude sexism the way that Kirk's sexcapades did, there are underlying messages that are questionable each series. The majority of the characters are male, and each iteration of the show has some overly sexualized female character. The shows try to portray the women as strong, but they cannot get beyond certain portrayals of women as in need of help.

His friend told him that one is a photograph, one is a painting, and one is a CGI rendering, but you can't tell which is which. Other than knowing that the images were created using three separate methods, they look exactly alike. The man looks at the information plate on the wall below each image. \n\nThe image in the middle is the photograph. \"This is just a photo of some fruit in a kitchen, *I* could've taken that.\" \n\nThe image on the left is the CGI rendering. \"Well, I guess you can do anything on a computer these days.\" \n\nThe image on the right is the painting. \"Wow, I can't believe someone painted this! This is a masterpiece!\" \n\nA museum guide comes over, looks at the information plates, and says: \"I'm sorry sir, someone changed these plates again. The image on the left is the photo, the middle one the painting, and the one on the right the CGI rendering.\" \n\nThe man responds: \"Oh, well then the left one is the masterpiece!\"\n\nThought experiment 2: \n\nTen year's from now, 3D printing has advanced to the point where  creating a life-sized model of a person is as easy as taking a photograph of someone.

These days, I'm more attracted to a woman who doesn't even trim over one who waxes or shaves entirely. Bare vaginas just look unnatural to me, and it has evolved into an actual turn off to get into bed with a partner who has one.\n\nPerhaps it's a disillusionment with the disconnect between the real women I interact with (wink, wink, nudge nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean?) and the prevailing (male-dominated) sex industry's image of \"perfection,\" but I find myself labeled as a bush \"fetishist\" by many men I bring this up to.

Aren't we ensuring that people are able to reproduce and raise the next generation of starving villagers when we send OUTSIDE sources of food? If the region were able to reach a self-sustainable population (whether by being able to produce food to feeds its people or to afford to import the food itself) would this not solve the problem of world hunger?\n\nComment 1: As Mrs.Pontellier pointed out, there is a sufficient supply of food globally to prevent starvation. The market of food is quite globalized, since we have big price adjustments when something changes in the American Great Plains or some parts of Brazil. It's unnecessary for a region to be self-sufficient, moreover cities have never been self-sufficient in food. The Roman Empire was partially defined by each province specializing in a different staple food crop and using the Mediterranean to trade back and forth.\n\nThe big famines now have two components, both of which are necessary for famine:\n1) Environmental Disaster: Droughts, floods, plague, or war that suppresses local production.\n2) Human Disaster: War, widespread disaster, or corruption that suppresses trade and aid shipments.\n\nYou haven't seen widespread starvation in Western Europe or the United States in centuries not associated with a World War in centuries. Why? Because when the natural disaster occurs trade and charity fills the gap. You do see famine where governments are hostile to the notion of aid, such as Ukraine in the 1920's, governments steal the aid for feeding soldiers, such as North Korea or the Congo, or there isn't a government at all and some competitors are openly hostile to everyone, such as China after the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 or the Sudan since 1991.\n\nBy addressing the failures of government you can eliminate most major famines. By strengthening local charity and local economies you can greatly speed up this process.\n\nMoreover, letting people starve wouldn't resolve the issue of famine, because it'\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1iuk8t", "utterance_id": "t1_cb86siw", "response_tokens": 147, "context_tokens": 462}}

By this, I mean that you see, hear, taste, smell and feel nothing that is not filtered, processed or otherwise distorted by your brain.\n\nSo why does your brain filter, process and distort sensory information?  Because  your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.  There is a selection advantage to accentuate survival maximising data that your senses pick up, and also to minimise sense-data that does not confer some sort of advantage, be it survival and/or reproductive.  That is to say that nobody's brain is selected for directly perceiving reality.  Only selected for perceiving elements of reality that relate to survival and promotion of genes.\n\nSo, I don't understand why it is appropriate to say that because someone who is psychotic, or under the effect of hallucinogens, has less legitimate contact with reality.  In fact, with psilocybin, brain regions that limit one's perception are temporarily inhibited and if anything, a more direct way of perceiving reality may be achieved.  (I am not a neuroscientist)\n\nThe only sense in which it is appropriate to say that someone that deviates from normal mental functioning is less in contact with reality is to say that they are less in contact with '*consensual reality*', which is by no means identical to actual reality.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2d9xj4", "utterance_id": "t1_cjnhx6m", "response_tokens": 151, "context_tokens": 317}}

I'd like somebody to talk me through the economic reasoning for having interest, before discussing the pros and cons, and moral implications.\n\nThe reason I believe it should be banned at the moment is because it allows money to be made simply from having wealth. It is a vehicle for the wealthy to accumulate wealth from the poor. \n\nAlso, there is no choice. If you want a loan, or have a bank account, you MUST pay/receive interest. There is no way you can withdraw your consent on ideological grounds: therefore we are trapped by interest. What are the results of this? It means payday loan companies like wonga can carry out state-sanctioned theft of your possessions and home to cover your debts. It means that you are penalised for not being rich. To say this is allowed when really there is no way you can disagree with the system seems wrong to me.\n\nBut why ban it? I admit I have only been clued into this view because usury is something that is criticised in Abrahamic religions. My view is not well informed and so I would like some people to convince me of the opposite view.\n\n**EDIT- So my view has evolved a bit, and to help me process everything I'm going to post a couple of points here.**\n\n1. So the main benefits of interest seem to be - compensating financiers for lending money, allowing small businesses to have access to capital, and allowing people to own items they otherwise wouldn't be able to. I am realising that economies will grind to halt if financiers cannot make money out of lending money without a viable alternative.\n2.

These songs lack originality in many ways that I have noticed:\n\n**Ear-pleasing guitar riffs have morphed into electronic beats**\n\nPart of this drop in the quality of music comes from this.

Formula isn't as good of nutrition, and should only be neccesary if there is a legitimate health concern where the mother and child can't feed.\n\nOver the course of millions of years, the Mammals have dominated our planet since the Cenozoic age. Our Name, \"mammal\" is a derivative of the word \"mammary\", the Teat gland. We've existed for millions of years feeding off our mother's teats, yet only recently have adopted synthetic formula. Breastmilk s literally biologically built to nurture babies, and It's a fools errand to try and prove that Formula is a better, healthier substitute for breastmilk. (By all means, show me data otherwise, i'm looking to give away a Delt)\n\nFormula isn't as good for baby, and it causes undue financial distress, but unfortunately is easier for new mothers. Breastfeeding is hard work, especially for new mothers, so oftentimes (In America, at least) we abandon hope of breastfeeding and switch to formula within the first day. formula companies stock hospitals and line doctors' pockets in order to rope new, frustrated mothers into the formula easy-train. I feel that this shouldn't be allowed, especially when formula is as expensive as it is.\n\nThe world heath organization says that Children should be breastfed exclusively until 6 months, and should continue to breastfeed with solid food until 2 years. \n\nhttp://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/\n\nIn America, roughly 4/5 of mothers ever try breastfeeding, and only 1/4 of mothers breastfeed until 6 months.\n\n(PDF via CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm)\n\nMy solution is simple: There is an international board that trains and certifies lactation consultants to inernational standards. they exist in America, but in appallingly small numbers.

It is unfair that these children should suffer, and be affected for the rest of their life.\n\nWhy should we be allowed to raise a child just because we have the ability to make babies? Or if its considered a moral right, why? In practise, this mean that there should be some sort of test/points system (I couldn't say the best way), to determine if the couple is fit to look after a child. Normally, since abuse is a minority issue, I would say that a blacklist system works better (fit to rear a child until proven otherwise), however, when you are dealing with someone's life, abuse is such a long lasting effect that I suggest a white list system.\n\nEdit: I did not mean to imply eugenics, but I see how it seems I would support it\n\nEdit2: Would just like to say I love you guys, really insightful and provoking stuff, I'll probably find some more of my views I'm not totally comfortable with to post later.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1sxioi", "utterance_id": "t1_ce27fv0", "response_tokens": 292, "context_tokens": 260}}

Whether by lie detectors, tears, pleas or whatever.  Liars adjust and they're out there, paying close attention to what works and what doesn't.  And they are sometimes caught and sometimes get away with it.  And I've got little inherent faith in our justice system to reliably recognize it happening.\n\nAn accusation of the kind of date rape that results in no injury is an extremely hard thing to be certain of.  So I am extremely skeptical of confident numbers that state that 97% of rape accusations are real.  How do we really know?\n\nI don't mean to diminish the importance of the crime by finding it hard to prosecute.  I've got no easy answers.  I've just never been swayed by conclusions that have large intuitive holes.\n\nThis problem is compounded by the tendency to believe the accuser.  This clearly encourages false accusers (I assume there'll be no dispute of that).  But how much?  I don't know?  How does anyone else really know?  \n\nI know the false accusers make the news out of all proportion to the honest accusers but that doesn't change the underlying suspicion I have that things that can be used as weapons (such as false rape accusations) will be used as weapons, and my intuition says it will happen much more frequently than seems to be commonly assumed.  \n\nThis is also complicated by another phenomenon that I never see discussed or considered.  Where the accuser is honest and the denier is honest too.  \"Rape-misunderstandings\" might be the least possible PC thing to acknowledge existing.  Am I the only one who suspects they're out there?

Were I in the UK, I would definitely say \"American Football\" and \"Football.\"\n\nTo give you some perspective, I am a football (NFL) fan, and in the past year I got much more into watching the games.

In soccer, it seems to me that any accidental unavoidable contact results in a penalty. The penalty at the end of the Netherlands - Mexico game basically completely decided the game, and as I recall, it didn't seem (at least to me) that it was intentional. As I recall, it was almost unavoidable, but it decided the entire game! One guy was trying to kick the ball, another guy was near him, and their legs touched, and that's the game! It was so unsatisfying.\n\n* If penalties aren't being called on the players, it seems to me like the players are *constantly, desperately* trying to get the refs to call penalties. **It seems like every time two people come within a couple of inches of each other, one of them intentionally falls down, looks at the ref angrily, sometimes pretends to hold their leg in pain, and in the case where a penalty isn't called, gets up and continues playing as if nothing happen\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_29koa9", "utterance_id": "t1_ciluvuu", "response_tokens": 935, "context_tokens": 440}}

I feel it is a comfortable way to ease people in to such serious topics. These two very permanent acts are also two very grim realities that some have to face in their life, even in our modern society.\n\nFinally, my view on offensive humor as a whole:\n\nI would be a hypocrite if I expressed offense to certain jokes. I like to tell jokes dealing with racial stereotypes on the regular.

The speaker is showing ignorance of that the \"sh\" sound is spelled \"sch\" in Germanic languages, and that the structure of the name is \"Roth-schild\", meaning \"red shield\". Its proper pronunciation is along the lines of \"roth-shild\".\n\n- US/English pronunciations of Latin phrases show the speaker's complete ignorance of how sounds are formed in romance languages. I can excuse the inability to pronounce the alveolar trill (rolled R), because it's not easily learned. But this doesn't excuse pronouncing \"a fortiori\" as \"ey for-tay-OR-ey\", when an authentic pronunciation would be \"ah for-tih-OR-ee\". It doesn't excuse pronouncing \"ex ante\" as \"ex AN-tee\" instead of \"ex AN-teh\", \"corpus delicti\" as \"KOR-pus dee-LIK-tay\" instead of \"KOR-pus deh-LIK-tee\", and so on.\n\nHearing US/English speakers pronounce things like that conveys the impression that they want to appear learned, but have done little learning; that their knowledge is superficial, rather than deep.

It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone) \n\nCalzones have several virtues over pizza.\n\n1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.\n\n2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center. \n\n3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!\n\n4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem.

Sadly, when people discus age of consent, they usually forget about that.\n\nAlso, it is ageist to believe that age equals maturity.\n\n3) Not every adult using their \"age advantage\" to force teenagers to have sex with them. And being over 21 year old doesn't mean you are safe from manipulative or abusive sex partners. \n\nHow to deal with those people should be explained in sex ed. classes.\n\n4) Different people have different sexual preferences. I for, example, absolutely not attracted by boys of my age, but love strong and mature grown-up guys. Another big fetish I have is crossdressing. I would love to be able to have sex dressed as girl before hormones make me masculine, but my government knows better. \n\nNote that I'm not being pro pedo, like many posts here, I'm just tired of people of my age being unfairly discriminated against.

This came to mind because as a straight dude, if I hypothetically want to hook up with a hypothetical girl and she has a hypothetical boyfriend, the hypothethical boyfriend might try and fight me although I believe I hypothetically did nothing wrong and all the blame goes on the hypothetical girl for not respecting her hypothetical existing relationships.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The belief that some people constitute better biological stock than others is hard to swallow; we do not choose our genes, and none of us like the idea of choices being made by others for our own supposed benefit. We believe that we have a right to reproduce, a right to bodily autonomy, that precludes government control of reproduction. Our individualist society places ultimate worth in the individual; no matter how beneficial something may be for the collective, it is *wrong* if it infringes on the rights of the individual. This is faulty reasoning, and an indication that we are out of touch with reality. The 'individual' does not exist; we are continuously and overwhelmingly shaped by external forces outside of our control (our genetic code, our upbringing in childhood, the societies in which we live). In turn, our actions shape the genetic makeup of the future, shape the future families and societies. This being realized, it is clear that to place the individual above all else is to suppose that each individual's self-interested actions will eventually benefit the collective as a whole. Adam Smith called this the [invisible hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand). Of course, Smith was referring solely to economic growth patterns, which are not necessarily good indicators of true progress. One need only comprehend the devastation wrought upon the Earth as a consequences of the Industrial Revolution to see that economic growth may not be a good thing after all.\n\nThroughout history we have been shown that in a competitive, individualized society, [that to which we are all entitled quickly becomes degraded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Which brings me to my point; something to which every individual feels entitled is the production of children. We shudder at the thought of someone other than ourselves controlling our prospective children. We can see no reason for another entity to restrict our ability to reproduce. However, such reasons do exist, and they are quite powerful. Among these are:\n\n1.

Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint and Ubuntu).\n\n1. Gaming. Games such as ARMA 3 or any other DirectX 11 games cannot be played on Linux at all. In fact, Steam refuses to download them. Even some directx 9 games cannot be played using Wine. (personal issues were splinter cell, battlefield (any of them), and SWBF2 to name a few.) \n\n2. Ease of use. Whenever I try to look up how to do something on Linux it always involves the terminal and confusing commands. With Windows, everything has a easy to use interface. Compared to Windows, Linux is not as polished and requires a lot of setup to easily use. \nMany technologically challenged people have no idea how to use the terminal, especially without Google's help.\n\n3. Drivers. I applaud Linux for its ability to easily recognize system drivers (chipset, USB stuff, etc) but when it comes to things such as joysticks and gaming controllers, even Nvidia drivers and other special drivers (ps3 eye webcam), the terminal has to be used with varying degrees of success. \n\n4. Applications. Almost every program is Windows only and has no alternative in Linux. Some examples are anything GPU/gaming related, (MSI afterburner, geforce experience, etc.) fan control, temp monitors, and any program that has an exe at the end.\n \nIn short, the excessive use of the terminal combined with the lack of common programs/drivers make Linux unusable for both the everyday consumer and the gamer.\n\nI am completely willing to change my view, as I have tried Linux many times with the same common issues appearing. I just see no benefit Linux has over Windows, besides being free.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The biggest problems that face troops don't have to do with supplies, funding, or a lack of training going into the conflict, but their transition back into society afterwards. We train them to go *into* the conflict, why would we not train them to *come out* of it?\n\nIf we **know** that many, many troops struggle with this, and we **know** how to treat it (obviously each case is different, but I mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods), it seems like a no brain-er that we should be doing something about it. In my mind, the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return. It could be just a month or two long (after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them), and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals, possibly [raising animals](http://www.helpguide.org/life/pets.htm), [spending a lot of time outside](http://depts.washington.ed\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1v6x7z", "utterance_id": "t1_cepid1d", "response_tokens": 1009, "context_tokens": 493}}

I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.

I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.

As a private citizen, away from my organization, I could send my children to public schools, claim welfare benefits, and enjoy the relative protections and upkeep of the state.  Pending how charismatic that I might be, I could have a relatively large compound with surface parking, attracting thousands of visitors, perhaps straining the roads and sewers of the small county that I reside in.  \n\nIt might not be easy to incorporate as a church, and I may be less than sincere, but it is possible.  My special authority on the universe will be difficult to challenge and I might tap into thousands of years of western religious traditions to cement my point.\n\nUltimately, the value that I provide as a church is only moderately questionable as the pretense is difficult to rule upon without infringing on my religion.\n\nIf I paid taxes on my church's earnings, then I would contribute to the quality of services provided by my state.  I would be free to lobby legislative bodies and more fully engage my government as a paying participant.  I could still incorporate as a nonprofit on the clearly defined activities that I participate in which do qualify with measurable purpose, but the effort that I spend reaping souls would be my own enterprise.\n\nIs there reason why church's shouldn't be treated as any other organization?

We no longer have a need for religion or a need to fear death as we can now answer many of the questions that people fled to religion to find.\n\n\n**1) Religion was created to answer questions of the unknown, we now have other resources that can answer these questions for us.**\n\n* Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete. We now understand human biology, space &amp; time (for the most part), human psychology, chemistry, plant life, animal life, water, air, drugs, sociology, there is a lot more that we know now that were unthinkable in the days of religion. We no longer need religious texts to help us understand life.\n\n\n\n**2) Religious books are outdated.**\n\n* They're old, and they preach teachings of a much more ignorant and fearful time. (If you need further explanation here then refer yourself to the Bible, Koran, Torah, you get it. Or just do a basic google search, \"bigotry in the _____\")\n\n\n\n**3) Religion has taught us to fear more than it has to love and has created utter hysteria on the topic of life and death.**\n\n* Religion teaches that when you die you have two options in the afterlife, eternal happiness in paradise, or eternal damnation. This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.\n\n* Because of religion people have been taught to fear death. Death is an inevitable event beyond our current comprehension that has existed since the beginning of time. It is not only pointless to fear death, but absurd.\n\n* Death is something in life that is uncontrollable and simply just happens. We don't have to understand death or what happens after death, we just have to understand it and accept it.\n\n* Death happens everyday, that's how life works, trying to come up with an answer to \"comfort\" yourself with is illogical and irrational.

Second of all, it doesn't matter if you have half the major military bases.  First of all, define \"major\".  Second of all, the other side would still have half of them, AND a higher population, AND more money, AND probably the support of many foreign nations (because who would want to side with the South, who would seem like backwoods racists).

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word *mariage*, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *marītāre*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. \n\nNow moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  \n\nNow I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  \n\n[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikiped\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_3df9or", "utterance_id": "t1_ct4nkic", "response_tokens": 207, "context_tokens": 437}}

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: If we want a perfect society where if I work hard I will get where I want, why material (usually money) heritage is not evil, killing the meritocracy system? Rich people will finance and give so much more opportunities (education, experiences, contacts, influence) to many generations of their offspring, how young people can compete equally so their merit will decide who deserves what and gives the best individuals of a society the top positions!?. Only moral heritage should be valid.\n\nComment 1: I will agree with the important of preventing an aristocratic class from accumulating most of the nation's wealth (oops, too late), but banning inheritance entirely is a mistake for the following reasons:\n\n* Funerals cost money, as does end of life care. These expenses can range up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is unlikely to be available in liquid assets for most, and leaving families on the hook for these costs when the dying person had the physical resources (perhaps a house that could be sold) to pay for it eventually is unethical.\n\n* Sometimes specific items have sentimental value. I own a violin that belonged to my great grandfather at the time he immigrated from Europe to the US, and though it isn't worth much, you can bet that I want to pass it on to my own kids someday. This would not change if the violin were instead worth $100k. Artworks could easily fall into this category while being worth much more.\n\n* Many people who grow up poor and struggle into the middle class do so in part out of a drive to leave their children with more than they had. They want to improve their family's lot. If there is no more material heritage, this drive is eliminated. \n\nIn order to level the playing field and establish a meritocracy, I think a better approach is to allow those with estates below some adequately large value to be passed on, and, crucially, at the same time provide services for health care, education, and child support through taxes so that even the poorest of children have a real opportunity to succeed. \n\nThe playing field will never truly be equal, because successful parents don't just come with money, but with connections to other successful people. Their children will benefit from these connections regardless of material inheritance, and there's not really anything to do about it.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1edqbg", "utterance_id": "t1_c9z90tn", "response_tokens": 177, "context_tokens": 471}}

Isolated from the community). Im thinking more along the lines of a voluntary online database, perhaps one that could only be accessed if the person with AIDS told you to check it. Something like this:\n\n* person A finds out he/she has AIDS\n\n* Person A then registers on this database, and informs his/her previous sexual partners. These people are sent a message with login information.\n\n* this could lead to people getting themselves checked out, and could lead to more people registering, informing their sexual partners, etc.\n\nI'm not sure of the logistics or how this would work out, but basically I think that people who have the disease HIV/AIDS need to be quarantined, added to a registry, or something like that so that they stop spreading the disease. We've spent Billions on AIDs research, but the current pharmaceutical technology we have isn't sophisticated enough to eradicate this disease. In the mean time, quarantining is the only other option we have.\n\nI know there could be a lot of social stigma around people who were quarantined, but I don't think it has to be that invasive (privacy wise). People with AIDS could be entered into a database that people without AIDS could check prior to engaging in sexual relations or the sharing of needles.

Let me also say that more than anything else, I believe strongly in the equality of not only the sexes, but races, sexualities, *everything*. I believe that everyone should be equal and I think this should really be common sense. And yet, I cannot bring myself to call myself a feminist. I think my reasoning for this is sound, and yet I constantly see people talk about how horrible anyone who claims to believe in equality yet doesn't use the term \"feminist\" is.

At first I fought against it, trying to argue my position, and I thought that I was doing well, but I just got called names and mocked for it.

I don't mind this when used in connection to women's rights - that's what it's for, right? And I certainly support women's rights, I just don't like the term because it seems to erase the fact that inequality is constant, from both sides. When someone says \"feminism IS the belief in equality for both genders\", they are right, in the technical sense, but by its very nature, feminism only focuses on women's issues. \"Masculinism\" is stupid for the same reason, with the added bonus of devaluing women's issues.

I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch.

For millenia, human survival was dependent on an acute awareness of one's surroundings, and this built in sense does not shut off just because we have developed civilizations and routine. A high activity level was also required in order to escape predators, and this also does not shut off just because someone has a long class or work day.\n\n\n\nChange my view.\n\nComment 1: So, let me see if I understand you points; you say that ADHD is fabricated because:\n\n1) Sitting, due to inactivity, leads to distractability which is a symptom of ADHD\n\n2) Survival was dependent on having a highly tuned sensitivity toward one's surroundings\n\n3) Because of the high energy level required for survival, simply because one is 'distracted' or 'high energy' does not mean they have a disorder\n\nYes?\n\nComment 2: Essentially yes. I am starting to think 'fabricated' may not have been the best descriptor of what I am thinking. I do not deny that these similar behaviors (ADD 'symptoms') exist, I just think they have been wrongly classified as problematic, and people have been misled and improperly prescribed drugs as a result of the hype.\n\nComment 3: Let's ignore the word fabricated and stick with 'overhyped'.

I don't mean objectification, like \"I can point at any girl on the street and have sex with her because I own her body LOLOL\". I don't even mean \"playing\". All I mean is being able to at some point in my life find a girl to marry who is compatible with me, on terms that are equally respectful to both myself and her.\n\nLet me give a bit of background. I'm a 29 year old successful professional with a full and interesting life. From my point of view (and from taking dating advice), I'd like to think that I have a lot of qualities that women would find attractive. Do you think women are drawn to success or money? I went to a top-5 school, I make money well into the six figures, and I own over $1M worth of real estate. What about creativity or intelligence? Besides singing, I play 2.5 musical instruments, I'm an internationally award winning dancer, I can speak 3 languages fluently, and I can get by in 10 more. Social skills or being an interesting person? I'm exceedingly polite, a good cook and conversationalist, and I have interesting hobbies that I like to share. Despite what you'll probably infer from this post (due to the nature of it), I'm actually both confident and modest in real life. And finally, the \"be attractive/don't be unattractive\" dichotomy? Well, I'm certainly not accidentally unattractive -- I'm in great shape, I dress in flattering, fitted clothing, and I take care of my hygiene. As far as \"be attractive\", I'm average, which shouldn't hurt or help me either way. I have my minor flaws in appearance, but so does everyone.\n\nI'm not looking for a supermodel genius. I actually have incredibly low standards, and my friends and family are often concerned at the quality of women I pursue (Are you sure? Are you drunk?). Yet, dating seems like a Sisyphean effort.

The arguments between these groups seem to arise from an inability of members of the latter group to comprehend someone simply not having the money to purchase all of their games.  \n\nAlso, the problem of piracy in general seems to primarily be a problem in countries with high rates of poverty, such as the US and other third-world countries.  \n\nErgo, it seems evident that people would purchase video games if they could afford to do so without potentially sacrificing something crucial to their survival/comfort (food, water, shelter, etc.).\n\nNote: I am not saying that no one would pirate games if everyone was wealthy.

What I mean when I say they should function as stop signs is that one should be able to stop, observe the intersection and, if it is clear, proceed with caution (similar to how right turns on red are currently executed). This would increase efficiency when driving without sacrificing safety very much, IMO. I feel like when I drive there are a vast number of occasions when it would be *completely* safe for me to go through the intersection, but it’s technically illegal until the light turns green. I’m sure the majority of other drivers experience similar situations. This wastes everyone’s time and even money (gas is burned while idling). This is especially true in the middle of night when there are times when you’re the only vehicle on the road where you’re driving. \n\nThis obviously wouldn't work at every intersection, as some intersections just have too much traffic going in too many directions, so here's my disclaimer that I agree there are exceptions. However, I do think these intersections could have a \"no turn on red from 7 AM - 6 PM\" or something, rather than a hard rule. I see signs like this in the city all the time. This way when there is no traffic at 3 AM people aren’t just idling at red lights for 2-3 minutes. The only hard exception I can think of is one where visibility is significantly limited, and it is difficult or impossible to tell if another vehicle is entering the intersection.\n\nAlso, I am in the US if that makes any difference.\n\nEdit: I awarded a delta to /u/hacksoncode for pointing that it would be logistically easier to simply switch to flashing reds/yellows in areas/times with low traffic. My view was only partially changed, as I still feel silly sitting at a red light when the coast is clear, but it was brought to my attention that this is the fault of inefficient traffic lights and it would be better to fix the lights than to complicate the law.

When you start talking about locking someone away for decades, and you realize actually the thousands and thousands of days you're taking away from person, and if that punishment really does match the severity of the crime... I don't think people actually have the capacity to imagine being sat in a small barred room day after day for that long.

I'm aware that being raped is an awful, traumatic experience, but a lot of the \"support\" that people like to offer victims seems more like pandering to their feelings than addressing the very real crime that occurred. I can sympathize with not being comfortable talking about something traumatic that happened to you, but the fact of the matter is that many rapists are repeat offenders. I often read posts where people decide not to report being raped, but then later decide to after hearing someone else was victimized by the rapist. Many of these cases could be avoided if people would report being raped in the first place. \n\nDoing some quick math from some stats provided by my school paper today, the conviction rate for people accused of criminal sexual conduct is ~23% (which is pretty good when you take into account that it's often a crime that leaves little to no evidence). While I'm sure that's a discouraging number, the more people that come forward about an individual, the higher the chances of them being convicted. I'm sure it's not easy to come forward, but by not doing so you are facilitating another rape committed by the same offender. As members of a community, it's our moral obligation to help protect each other when we can. Not doing so is taking the easy way out that will cause other people's lives to be destroyed as much as yours.\n\ntl;dr Not coming forward to the authorities about your rape facilitates the same person raping other people.

For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:\n\n* Article 3\n\n&gt; Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\n\nIf one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as \"dishonouring the family\" or \"acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman\". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:\n\n&gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her \"guardian\", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.\n\nBecause of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant.

In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:\n\nFirst, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. \n\nSecond of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds.

No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with \"hey are you okay?\" and \"Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave.\" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.\n\n2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.\n\n3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that \"justifies\" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.\n\nEven if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: I believe that absolute values for moral and immoral behavior exist, and that every action is in fact made up of several separate moral and immoral components. Within this system moral behavior could be broadly described as that which endeavors to aid the human race, protect life and human rights, and preserve a healthy environment for the prolonged future of the species. Immoral behaviors could be similarly defined as those which are purposed to bring death or injury to another, those which benefit one member or subset of the human race at the expense of another, those which actively neglect another human in need, or otherwise do physical, emotional, spiritual or other harm to humans on any scale.\n\n\nFor example, a police officer responds to an armed robbery in progress. In the course of discharging his duties he is forced to fire his weapon at the perpetrator, killing him, to prevent the death of the victim. The police officer has done both a moral act (in protecting the life and property of the establishment and victim) as well as an immoral one (in taking a human life).\n\n\nObviously this system is flawed and the various \"shades of grey\" become harder and harder to distinguish in higher-order situations (such as making an immoral decision to preserve resources for a later, larger moral decision; or else the only \"pure white\" path through life would be to give away everything you own and wander the world doing what good you could without ever keeping anything for yourself). Personally, however, I take issue with the fact that I can't come up with a scenario which allows for one to realistically make it through life without making immoral choices.\n\n\nAll thoughts appreciated, of course, but specifically I'm looking for things which help me reconcile the fact that I'm pretty much doomed to make immoral choices and can't do anything about it. That could be showing me a way to work my system to \"live white,\" convincing me that the black/white line is in a different place than I believe, showing me how to be ok with living some shade of grey, or whatever else you brilliant folks come up with.

They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the middle class, they aren't doing much that actually helps them.\n\nThe inflation: Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows in the suburbs or small towns. Quite often siblings would share a bedroom, there would be fights over who got to shower first because there was only one shower and a finite amount of hot water. You packed a sandwich for lunch, dad drove the one car the family owned and would own for the next 10 years to work and mom walked or took transit if available. Clothing was handed down to younger siblings or cousins, there was one modestly sized TV in the house, and when families got a computer it was for the entire family to share. Vacations where often to go camping somewhere which would involve tents and no electricity, not 50' trailers with full kitchens, bathrooms and wifi, and if you were to go on a trip to another country or something, it was something the family saved up for and didn't happen every year. If something was broken, you fixed it instead of throwing it out and buying three more. \n\nWhile all of that might sound like it came out of Leave it to Beaver or The Brady Bunch, I grew up in the 90's. \n\nNow, \"middle class\" people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing, cars, and other goods.

Center-left economists including Paul Krugman have endorsed the scheme for various reasons. First, BI is an effective anti-poverty measure. BI also reduces inequality by redistributing income from capital to labor. Perhaps most importantly to some on the left, is the notion that BI provides people with \"freedom.\" Left-libertarian political economist Philippe Van Parijs argues that to be truly free, people have to have \"access to the means that people need for doing what they might want to do.\" BI provides people those means. Some have made a feminist case for BI. Philosopher Carole Pateman writes, BI \"would, for the first time, provide women with life-long (modest) economic independence and security, a major reason why it is central to democratization.\"\n\nBasic income, particularly in the form of a \"negative income tax,\" is also popular among the libertarian right. With a NIT in place, much of the welfare state would be obsolete: you could get rid of food stamps, child nutrition programs, public housing, cash welfare, community development programs, Medicaid, and a host of means-tested welfare programs. It would simplify the bureaucracy, and get rid of the \"unemployment trap\" that occurs under the existing system. Also, basic income advocates on the right want to give people the power and authority to spend money in whatever manner they choose: they dislike how the government forces welfare recipients to use their welfare handouts on purchasing food, for example. \"Benefits are often given in-kind rather than in cash precisely because the state doesn’t trust welfare recipients to make what it regards as wise choices about how to spend their money,\" University of San Diego's Matt Zwolinski writes. A basic income, Zwolinski continues, would change that. Basic income is \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" because it makes individuals responsible for their own livelihoods and flourishing. If they make good decisions, so be it, if they make bad decisions, so be it. But the government shouldn't force people to use transfer payments in a particular manner. Conservatives also like \"basic income\" because it would allow for less regulations on the marketplace: minimum wage\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_30oi71", "utterance_id": "t1_cpudthh", "response_tokens": 973, "context_tokens": 480}}

In Elementary, Holmes has recently been a drug addict, addicted to heroine who has now fought to sobriety. This sets up the fateful meeting between him and Watson (played by Lucy Liu) who is working as a sober companion. Why is Dr Watson a sober companion? Because she made a 1 in a 10000 (or something) mistake that took the life of her patient. Leaving her without the confidence to perform surgery. She still wants to help people and therefore goes into sober companionship which eventually leads to being Holmes's underling.\n\nThe characters are burdened by deep emotions that they are constantly fighting in order to save the city suffice it to say.\n\nIn Sherlock, the meeting between Holmes and Watson is more of a \"just get on with it\" sort of deal. As Watson is walking through the park, sees an old friend, who happens to know Sherlock. They are both looking for a roommate and voila..they meet and go on adventures together.\n\nThere are other examples but I'll stop there before I spend all night writing!\n\nSo CMV, convince me that the BBC version is just as in depth, better, more interesting...what have you more so than elementary.\nYes the subjective nature of the art form is up for debate and that's why you can pick which way you think the BBC version is better than the CBS one.\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_1xvch2", "utterance_id": "t1_cff03ce", "response_tokens": 419, "context_tokens": 415}}

Nigeria passed an incredibly homophobic law this January, and Uganda and Kenya have followed suit. The long and short of it is that if I tried to live openly back home, I would be put in prison for any period of time ranging from between 10 and 14 years. \n\nI realize that this law and others like it are possibly in violation of several human rights declarations which these countries have ostensibly ratified. I also want this law to be repealed and for this discrimination against sexual minorities to end.\n\nHowever, as people who follow this issue are aware, the African nations that have these laws on their books have resisted calls to repeal these laws. They view calls for repeal as the West trying to impose its moral standards on Africa, which has expressed its morality through the passage of these laws. I am aware of the logical inconsistency of this position (i.e., that the homophobia is a result of the adoption of religion, which itself is a Western import), and do not want to discuss that here. What I do wonder is that the leaders of these nations have asked that they be respected as sovereign nations, and for the West to respect their laws. They say that just as they do not impose their cultural norms on the West, the West should not impose their cultural norms on Africa, and the most common example they cite is that of polygamy. It is very common in several African nations, but (I was surprised to learn) is actually criminalized in the US and Canada. So if the West criminalizes the African cultural practice of polygamy and is unwilling to repeal the laws that do so, then surely African nations can criminalize homosexuality and the West should leave them alone.\n\nI'm not sure how to mount an argument to this. The right to marry a consenting spouse is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so if a woman/man decides to marry another man/woman with an existing spouse, it should not be criminal as long as the three of them consent to it.\n[...context truncated...]\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_2byn8t", "utterance_id": "t1_cja699z", "response_tokens": 201, "context_tokens": 429}}

Since I work as neuroscientific researcher with ties to the medical field, I think it is important that I understand this issue. I would mention that I think it is primarily a problem of nomenclature and the stigmas that are associated with mental illness, things that shouldn’t but do affect the DSM, as I can’t think of a logical reason that homosexuality isn’t considered a mental illness (based on the conventions below) – end disclaimer**\n\n\nThe definition I find most prevalent in conversations with my colleagues for a mental illness is basically:\n\n**A neural disorder or deviation from the norm that leads to disadvantageous behavior or thought processing, or other negative cognitive effects for the individual.**\n\n\nAs I understand it, the current prevailing belief with regards to the origin of homosexuality is that there is a hormonal error in utero.

Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.\n\nI don't think it's too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They aren't interested in making a monetary profit, they're interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video, you're showing them that there is demand for more of this content, and they've demonstrated they're willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people don't view the video out of respect for James.\n\nChild pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit, but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation, and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice, the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video.\n\nIt's interesting to me that everyone in the r/worldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal, while I'm fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. I'm not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal, I'm just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. \n\nOne argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity, while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content.

You can say what you want and not encounter any type of resistance, punishment or retribution that is within the confines of the law.\n\nBy nobody I don't mean one specific person. So maybe the prince of Aberjizan can say what he wants because he can have people killed with a wave of his hand, I mean a group of people. Or someone standing in the woods with nobody to hear them, that obviously doesn't count either and sort of relates to my final point on this about whether words matter or not.\n\nSo why I don't think anyone is free to say whatever they want, in the most simplistic terms. If you walk up to someone and tell them you are going to kill them they can shoot you in self defence. Perfectly legal and reasonable for them to do so if they believed you. But you were killed for only what you said...\n\nWhat I think this demonstrates; words have meaning. Words convey ideas, thoughts, plans and actions. If what you say didn't mean anything then what would be the point of saying anything? Thus if words have this meaning then surely you should be responsible for them? \n\nThat shit church that always pickets funerals for example, is entirely designed to evoke peoples anger to try and get them to disrupt them in a way they can sue for. They use words to incite violence against themselves, how can you not hold someone responsible for that? What if a politician makes a promise and then completely goes back on it? Shouldn't he be responsible for his words? He used it to sway the course of democracy, is it really a fair vote if he just lied to win? What if your bank lied about what they did with your money? Or your kids teachers about how well they were doing?^*\n\nI believe that either total freedom of speech is a bad thing or that there is a misinterpretation of what that means and people don't stop to think about it because it's a buzz word like 'patriot'.

I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends, to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly 50 pounds over those 2 years, and I was failing all my classes. I wasn't even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also, I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them, but it occupied my mind quite a bit. \n\nI wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time, and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it, and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasn't able to do any of that.

Coming from a very competitive environment, I have definitely become used to the stresses associated with comparing myself to others. While I do not think it is the best for my mental health, I do think it gives me a massive edge over others. I say this because when you compare yourself, it allows you to see where you stand against others and can cue a desire to improve.\n Furthermore, I think the argument of 'we are all unique people, so why compare' is a way to justify our desire not to work for the results. This view allows us to be content with our flaws and gives us the cue that we can't achieve those goals that others have achieved when. I honestly believe that if I stop comparing myself to people, I will lose the edge in my career path (music) and will not be viewed as serious.  \n Ultimately, people who do not compare themselves are not being realistic and are hiding from reality. In the real world, we are always compared against other people and this is how we grow against others. If I was to stop comparing myself, then I would not be able to see where I stand in the real world and, thus, would have a distorted view of reality.  Besides, every compares each other anyway so why not do it to ourselves first to see where we already are.\n____\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We live in an era of abundance where countries as small as Estonia are capable of producing the food supply for the entire planet. There is no constraint when it comes to basic necessities such as food, clothing or shelter. \nThis is very different from the pre-world war II era when the world still did not have the technical prowess to meet the demands of the world. It is different from the world where Gallbraid hypothesized that population growth will exceed the rate at which we increasing output. He was wrong. \nToday, the rich and poor don't fight for the same goods and services. Even though there is disparity between how much rich and poor earn, there is no pressure from the rich hogging resources such as food. If anything, the rich spend their income on lavish items such as yatches, cars and many other material items which although valuable are not necessary for survival. \nSo what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the have-nots jealous of the have's? I understand their are ethical issues with it, but what I'm more concerned with is, how income inequality can be bad for society, the economy or our general well being? \n\n[Response to your replies]: A lot of you have pointed out that income equality leads to higher child mortality rates, health, etc. Although some of it is convincing, there is not enough evidence to support causation. \nOthers have pointed out that income equality is cause of poverty. This assumption is based on the fact that we have limited resources and when equality rises, the rich hog more resources while poor are left with none. Again, I must urge that there is lack of evidence in this theory as well. The economic pie has been growing and the rich has been simply getting a bigger slice, and there is a legitimate reason for it. Since the wave of globalization started, the wealthy got even wealthier because they had seen their markets grow far bigger than ever before.

No idea what the response will be to this.\n\nI've become dissatisfied with the model glorified by the porn/sex industry that paints women as hairless, and to me it seems odd to sleep with/go down on a lady who is bare down there. \n\nThis has not always been the case, there were times when it excited me (as in when I was in my late teens and newish to sex), but pubic hair simply seems like the natural way of things, and I prefer a woman who trims over one who shaves. These days, I'm more attracted to a woman who doesn't even trim over one who waxes or shaves entirely. Bare vaginas just look unnatural to me, and it has evolved into an actual turn off to get into bed with a partner who has one.\n\nPerhaps it's a disillusionment with the disconnect between the real women I interact with (wink, wink, nudge nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean?) and the prevailing (male-dominated) sex industry's image of \"perfection,\" but I find myself labeled as a bush \"fetishist\" by many men I bring this up to. I don't regard this as a fetish (I have a few real ones, I know what a fetish is), simply as a realistic view of sex and the female body, and I find myself actively turned off recently by images, videos or depictions of entirely nude vaginas. Please, change my view - in your opinion, am I simply talking to the wrong people about this, perusing the wrong sites, looking at the issue in too much black/white, or am I actually a bush fetishist?\n\n[TASK]\nWrite the next message that continues the conversation and aims to persuade the other person.\n\n[RESPONSE]\n", "metadata": {"source": "cmv", "conversation_id": "t3_24c1q3", "utterance_id": "t1_ch61d0c", "response_tokens": 657, "context_tokens": 380}}

This is simply a belief that I've held for quite some time, based on my study of history and observation of present-day situations. Unfortunately I can't seem to bring this up without being called racist, so I'm genuinely interested in hearing a sound argument that doesn't involve that logic. \n\nI believe that slavery gave African descendants a better future in the Americas (particularly the USA) than they would have otherwise had in Africa. \n\nAfrica was, and still is, a pretty awful place to live in. Between AIDS and other diseases, famine, civil unrest, inadequate healthcare, lack of electricity/water, and non-existent educational systems, shouldn't African Americans be glad that they are in America now and not Africa? Would today's African Americans not certainly be in a worse state if they had been born in Africa today? \n\nI'm well aware that the initial slaves brought over had to suffer horrific atrocities and it is a tragedy that they had to be subjected to such immense terror. They clearly did not benefit. But their children? Or their grandchildren? The African Americans of today, aren't they better off because of slavery? \n\nSo that's about it, Change My View.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to point out that I'm not a big fan of the hypothetical \"what if we hadn't gotten involved\" argument with Africa. I get that Africa *could* have been better off, but I also feel that in the time that's passed some progress could have been made as well. Other countries have done more in less time, often with poor circumstances. So that argument really hasn't worked for me. \n\nBut I'd like to say thanks to /u/fibonacciapples for putting a different spin on things by pointing out that I should consider the entirety of time between slavery and today, not just the present state of African-Americans.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I just haven't seen any evidence for it, yet it seems to be brought up a lot in real life and on reddit.\n\nI have asked quite a few different people but I've never gotten anything more than a very weak argument purely based on opinion. I'm looking for evidence. I'm looking for someone to give me at least one example of a situation where a white person would have an innate advantage over a minority. \n\nIt's very easy to find evidence for the other way around. For example, [this list of scholarships](http://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/minority-scholarships/) shows where minorities have a very clear advantage over white people when it comes to financial aid for higher education. It took me 5 seconds on google to find that page. I'm looking for something like this, something you could use as a source in a formal debate.\n\nI'm looking for evidence, **NOT OPINION**. I cannot stress this enough, my view will not be changed because you tell me that white privilege exists and I just can't see it. My view will not be changed because you tell me that people just see me as more professional or educated because I'm white, because that has nothing to do with race and has everything to do with the way I present myself. It cannot be something that is attributed to culture, just race. Growing up a gangbanger lifestyle is not a race issue, it's a culture issue. \n\nI'm not a racist person, and if there is a situation where I, a white person, would have an innate advantage over a minority purely based on my race, I want to know about it so I can avoid being put into an innately racist position.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm getting a lot of replies citing how ethnic sounding names vs white sounding names affect job interviews.

You should acknowledge uncertainty and avoid manipulation.\n\n[CONTEXT]\nOriginal Post: What I have a hard time understanding is why women choose to get abortions knowing that they are ending a human life. It is very hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that women can be so selfish to give up a life, when there are families out there trying so hard to have children, but can’t. In our society today, the amount of people looking to adopt is so large that almost any person who doesn't want to keep their child can find a suitable home for him/her. Growing up in a conservative, catholic, family has definitely altered my view about abortion, and going to catholic school has pushed it even farther. Abortion is against the catholic religion, and there are many different family planning options that anyone can use. I have learned for years that abortions can cause severe emotional trauma, and many people regret it afterwards, so why should it be allowed in the first place. I have also heard many times that it is the women’s body and she should decide what to do with it. Yes, I do believe that to be true in some sense, but once you have another life inside of you, it isn't just your body, its their body too. Abortion was illegal in the United States for some time, but eventually was ruled constitutional by some means. With all of that being said, I do agree that there needs to be better sources of education for troubled women who don’t have anyone to turn to for guidance. I also know the dangers if the woman’s life is at risk, but in modern society there are many different approaches that can deal with these situations. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When victims do not report their sexual assaults, especially if they know who did it, it allows the assaulter to continue to commit these crimes. \n\nI'm not saying we should force people to anything, or punish them if they don't. However, I believe that when victims don't report their assaults, they are being irresponsible and dismissive of the fact that others may also become victims. \n\nI do not believe that the victim is at fault for the attackers crimes. I do not believe that the way a person dresses, how they act, or how much they drink contributes to them being sexually assaulted. I place blame firmly on the attacker, and the attacker only. However, I believe that if someone is sexually assaulted, knows who it is, doesn't report it, and the attacker assaults someone else, that the person who failed to report it is not necessarily at fault, but contributed to the ability of the assaulter to enter a position to assault again. \n\nAn example is if person Y is at a party, and X has been hanging around getting Y drinks all night. X and Y knew each other before the party. X puts something in Y's drink that renders Y unable to resist or give consent. X then sexually assaults Y, and leaves Y at the party.
